    "Open marketplaces with semi-anonymous review platforms have a significant problem, bot generated reviews. This issue is exacerbated by the common availability of high powered, free pre-trained models that puts the strength of advanced NLP neural networks in to the hands of everyone. The double edged nature of these powerful models is that they're amazing for research and advancement, but they also put the powers of near human levels of context and speech generation into the hands of black-hat users. \n",

    "Initially we attempted to utilize 51 million book reviews as provided by [Julian McAuley](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#google_local) in a single dataframe. Due to the nature of dataframes, being memory inefficient and unable to stream data, we had to engineer a work-around. After further research we decided upon MongoDB. \n",
    "\n",
    "### MongoDB\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a simple document based database system that provides great flexibility in its expandability and extensibility. It does this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Offering JSON-like document storage, meaning data structure can change document to document\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easily map objects to application code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real-time aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distributed at its core.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Free to use under the (SSPLv1 license)\n",
    "\n",
    "For our uses we were able to load in a 51 million `20+gb` `JSON` file up as a database. We were then able to aggregate and further sample the data so that we could feed a selection of the reviews into our model for fine tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus in the end we ended with a corpus of 50,000 reviews on which to train our `GPT2` model for review text generation. We chose not to push the number further due to lack of computer resources. Were we working with a distributed network architecture we could've easily expanded the corpus size."

As he was nursed back to health, Mortenson was shocked to learn that Korphe\\'s children had no school, with lessons taught outdoors just three days a week. Kids learned to write using sticks in the dirt. To repay the village\\'s kindness, Mortenson promised to return, and help build a school.\\n\\nMortenson did come back to Korphe, and has indeed helped build not just one but fifty-five schools -- many for girls -- in both Pakistan and Afghanistan.\\n\\nThe idea of \"three cups of tea\" comes from Korphe\\'s village chief, Haji Ali. \"With the first cup of tea you are a stranger, with the second you become a friend, and with the third, you join our family.\"\\n\\nMany parts of Mortenson\\'s story are thrilling as he describes his adventures in such a dangerous part of the world. A trip to Afghanistan, for example, comes complete with red rocks that signal land mines: \"There are millions of land mines buried all over Afghanistan, left there by armies after years and years of war. When one is found -- usually because it explodes -- rocks in the area are painted red, as a warning.\"\\n\\nA story like this is both inspiring and eye-opening, and should help kids feel closer to children in other parts of the world.\\n\\nBonus features include maps of the region; a foreword by Dr. Jane Goodall; an interview with Mortenson\\'s teenage daughter Amira, who has traveled with him in his work; and two sections of color photos printed on glossy paper.\\n\\nHere\\'s the chapter list:\\n\\nMaps\\nForeword by Dr. Jane Goodall\\nIntroduction\\nChapter 1: Failure\\nChapter 2: The Wrong Side of the River\\nChapter 3: I\\'m Going to Build You a School\\nChapter 4: Growing Up\\nChapter 5: 580 Letters, One Check\\nChapter 6: Hard Way Home\\nChapter 7: Korphe at Last\\nChapter 8: A Bridge Before a School\\nChapter 9: Hunting Ibex\\nChapter 10: Building Bridges\\nChapter 11: Six Days\\nChapter 12: Beginnings\\nChapter 13: Haji Ali\\'s Lesson\\nChapter 14: A Smile Should Be More Than a Memory\\nChapter 15: A Picture\\nChapter 16: New Schools -- and More\\nChapter 17: Running From War\\nChapter 18: Too Much to Do\\nChapter 19: A Village Called New York\\nChapter 20: Afghanistan\\nChapter 21: The First Educated Woman in Korphe\\nChapter 22: Stones into Schools\\nQ&A with Amira Mortenson\\nTime Line\\nGlossary\\nWho\\'s Who in Three Cups of Tea\\nReaders Guide',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Another satisfying read from the Royal Spyness series.\\n\\nI received an advanced reader copy of \"Malice at the Palace\" from a give-away conducted by the author - Rhys Bowen.  Having read all the books in the series to-date I was excited to get my hands on the latest installment.  In this book, Georgie has returned from America and is once again in search of a home and employment to get her by.  Luckily, the queen gives her the assignment of acting as Princess Marina\\'s companion until her wedding to Prince George (the queen\\'s youngest son).  This assignment comes with not-so-plush digs in Kensington Palace.\\n\\nThe mystery turns up in the corpse of Prince George\\'s ex-girlfriend, Bobo Carrington, found by our intrepid Lady in the courtyard of the Palace after a dinner with the Royal Family.  Bobo has a mysterious past and Georgie must discover if it was that past or Bobo\\'s more recent connections to Prince George that caused her untimely death - without word leaking to the press (or the Princess) and causing a Royal Scandal.\\n\\nGeorgie\\'s standard cast of helpers - Belinda, Grandad, Queenie and of course, Darcy - are on hand to assist.  Belinda\\'s American experiences seem to have changed her and may lead to some interesting character development as the series moves on.  And there is a delightful cliffhanger for Darcy and Georgie\\'s relationship at the end of the book - is Ms. Bowen going to do what so few cozy authors do, either end or progress the relationship?\\n\\nThis installment of the series gives readers more of what the love about the Royal Spyness series - a good mystery with great historical detail and enjoyable characters (one exception - see below).  The writing is good and the mystery is solid - most readers will deduce who did it but that\\'s a part of the fun!  I was excited to see changes in some of the character\\'s perspectives in this edition and hope that there will be more exciting changes to come in future books.\\n\\nMy only request with the series - enough of Queenie!  While an amusing character at first and a useful tool to show Georgie\\'s compassion - we get it, she\\'s not needed anymore.  I\\'m sure another use can be found for her (victim, perhaps?) in the next book.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This novel is told from varying viewpoints, which doesn\\'t usually work when so many different views are handled (there are 4) but in this novel they seem to flow together effortlessly and make this novel all the more better.  Lolly is the owner of the Inn and her daughter, Kat, helps her run it.  Her two nieces, June and Isabel, grew up at the Inn after their parents death and visit infrequently.  Everyone is called home for a meeting with Lolly whom seems to have no feelings and is a cold woman.  The only time anyone sees a bit of emotion from Lolly is when she\\'s watching movies, especially ones featuring her favorite actress Meryl Streep.\\n\\nI found myself surprised with how much I enjoyed this novel and how much I cheered all 4 of the women through their various stories.  The story is well told and the messages don\\'t get TOO lost in the changing viewpoints.  It did take me a bit to sort out who-was-who but once I did it was an easy read.  The only real downfall I had with the book was how it was a little over the top the \"lessons\" these women learn through the book while watching the different movies.  It was a tinge on the after school special lines for me.  Beyond that though, I really loved this book and hope to see more from this author in the coming years.  I would even enjoy a sequel to this novel to see where these girls continue to go.  Things are tied up at the end but there is always more to the story :)',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'As usual, this year\\'s editor has put together an excellent collection of Science Writing. But the thing I tend to like about the series is that it contains a little bit on a lot of subjects. Not so this time. The stories generally fall into four categories: genetics, ethics/expos&eacute;, the brain, and the environment.\\n\\nGenetics: The first, Facing Life with a Lethal Gene is, unforgettably, about a girl who chooses to learn her genetic fate. The second, An Error in the Code, concerns a genetic defect that causes persons to tear themselves apart, while the third explains the benefits and limitations of the work done by genetic testing companies. In the ethics/expos&eacute; category falls six stories: How NIH Misread Hormone Study in 2002; Psychiatrists, Children, and Drug Industry\\'s Role; What\\'s Normal [\"the controversy in diagnosing bipolar disorder in the very young\"]; After Sanctions, Doctors Get Drug Company Pay; Dr. Drug Rep; When Is a Pain Doctor a Drug Pusher?; and Supply, Demand, and Kidney Transplants. Those involving the brain include: The Abyss [a man whose brain can not lay down memories], Duped [lie detection], and The Older-and-Wiser Hypothesis [Does wisdom increase with age?]. In the final, environment, category are four essays: a five pager by Al Gore on (what else) Global Warming, two about China (1 - the country is running out of water, 2 - a whistle-blower tried to sound the alarm on chemical factories\\' poisoning of a lake and suffered the consequences), and, finally, Sowing for Apocalypse, which I\\'d read elsewhere, about a Noah\\'s Arkian collection of seeds from all over the world, kept safe in case of a cataclysmic event on earth. You see, only one piece, about the loss of effectiveness of the human body\\'s evolution-related defenses against cancer, entitled Evolved for Cancer?, doesn\\'t fit my categories.

       "  'reviewText': '\"The Third Reich in Power\" is the second part of Richard J. Evans\\'s projected trilogy on the Nazi Dictatorship.  The first book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Coming-of-the-Third-Reich/dp/0143034693/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Coming of the Third Reich</a>, narrated German history since Bismarck, explaining how the various elements of what we know as Nazism grew during the 19th century, intensified as a result of Germany\\'s defeat during the Great War, and then rose to power following the Great Depression and the inept political leadership of both the traditional right and left.\\n\\n\"The Third Reich in Power\" picks up where the previous volume has left.  Hitler\\'s regime is now in power, but it is not in control.  Even at their prime, the Nazis never won a majority of the popular vote.  Most Germans had at best a partial allegiance of the regime, undermined (at least in Nazi eyes) by their association with the Churches or the trade unions.  Although competing political parties where quickly outlawed, the former Social Democrats and Communists were no fans of the regime, and the Conservative circle around President Hindenburg had allowed Hitler to assume the chancellery of Germany, but had expected full well to remain in control.  Pockets of -potential- resistance existed in the Universities and the armed forces, and even inside the Nazi Sturmabteilung (better known as the SA).  And of course, there were the Jews, the mythical, eternal enemies.\\n\\n Most of the volume details how the Nazi state dealt with the challenges of winning over the German population.  The means included propaganda, control of the media, Arts and Press, Nazified education system, popular programs of Social redistribution such as Strength Through Joy, a program offering subsidized cultural and social events for the people, an economic recovery and the prestige won through the regime\\'s foreign policy triumphs.  But they also included darker means - concentration camps and secret police, military purges, racial laws and even Pogroms.\\n\\nEvans divides his book to theme based chapters, one for the Arts and the Press, one for Religion and Education, and one each exploring the Police State, the Economy, the Racial Laws, and Foreign Policy.  As in his previous volumes, Evans manages to \\'hit\\' all the best known items in the Third Reich.  So we encounter Leni Riefenstahl directing \"The Triumph of the Will\", Eichmann directing the Aryanization of Jews, The Catholic Anti-Nazi encyclical Mit Brennender Sorge, and Martin Neimuller\\'s poem \"First they came...\"\\n\\nEvan\\'s narrative is best when he manages to demonstrate the effects the Nazi regime had over the lives of simple people.  The travails of best selling author Rudolf Ditzen, for example, are page turning, and demonstrate the difficulty of living under Germany\\'s dictatorship even if one was neither a political opponent nor a handicapped nor a Jew (pp. 149-152).\\n\\nAs in the previous volume, Evans\\'s thoroughness as a researcher is sometimes at odds with his Powers as story teller, and we are sometimes subjected to fatiguing details of disciplines in Nazi Prisons or Bureaucratic infighting.  Furthermore, some of the best parts are narratives from fairly well known German diarists, such as Jewish Literature Professor Victor Klemperer and League of German Girls activist Melita Maschmann.\\n\\nUnfortunately, in my view, Evans mostly spares the reader the details of scholarship controversy.  Only the footnotes contain hints of controversy regarding Nazi influence in Universities, the Fuhrer\\'s involvement in the regime, and the Nazi\\'s status as \"Hitler\\'s Willing Executioners\".  The most interesting question of the Nazi economic recovery, whether or not the Nazis pursued a progressive Keynesian recovery program, is hinted to but not developed enough.\\n\\nThe major insight I gained from \"The Third Reich in Power\" was the centrality of Hitler\\'s projected eventual European War on the Third Reich.  Everything in Nazi Germany was subordinate to the needs of Rearmament, and Hitler risked endangering the economic recovery and the quest for Autarky, and even the pace of the Anti-Jewish persecution, in order to achieve readiness.\\n\\nAnd the War Came... the culmination of the Nazi Project, the fight for Lebensraum and eventual world domination, occurred when Britain had finally abandoned its policy of Appeasement and declared War on Germany, following Hitler\\'s invasion of Poland.  Although the German people were far from enthusiastic about the War, they had followed their leader, and they had now answered to his call.  Everything the Nazi Regime had worked for was set to come during the War:  the Solution of the Nation\\'s perceived need for Space and Resources, the regaining of the lost position of Germany as the World Leader, and the solution, as last final, the Jewish Problem.  But Evans\\'s account stops now, and we must patiently wait for his last volume, \"The Third Reich at War\"',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Based upon a true story, this is the epic telling of the life of a woman named Merewyn, who lived during the tumultuous tenth and eleventh centuries. Her mother had been the victim of one of the Viking raids on the coast of Cornwall. As a result, Merewyn was born. Her life was to change when a Prince of Provence named Rumon, the sole survivor of a shipwreck, was washed upon the shores near Merwyn's home.\\n\\nAs Rumon is a Prince of the House of Atheling, he is looking for his royal kin. Fourteen year old Merewyn, her mother having died of illness, acts as his guide. When they get to Court, Merewyn, who believes herself to be descended from King Arthur, is afforded a place in the Queen's retinue, while Rumon becomes great friends with the King. The King has two sons, Edward by his first wife, and Ethelred by his second wife, the beautiful Queen Alfrida, who is as evil as she is beautiful.\\n\\nThe years pass, and Merewyn, who was originally fond of the Queen, finally sees her for what she is. Rumon, however, falls under her thrall, much to Merewyn's dismay, as she has fallen in love with him. When the King mysteriously dies, Edward ascends the throne at the age of fourteen. Unfortunately, he, too, meets an ignominious end, and his younger brother, Ethelred, becomes King. He will eventually be known as Ethelred the Unready.\\n\\nAgainst this historical backdrop, Merewyn and Rumon live out their lives, star-crossed lovers whose lives, though intersecting, are never able to be joined. They would each find themselves on a path in which happiness would elude them. How they reconcile their respective fates and where the road of life leads them makes for an enjoyable tale told by a master storyteller. Set against the backdrop of Viking raids, battle, and adventure, this is a well-researched and well-written work of historical fiction that those who enjoy this particular genre will relish.\",\n",

Her actual record is quite good. Many people don't like her because she is more middle class than fancy, rich, socialite upper class. I find that refreshing and a positive thing. She is regular person trying to do what's right, for a change. In that sense, she is a rogue. She is also not perfect but then who is? More real, working class people should stand up and go for it.

However, it gave me many chuckles and a feeling of superiority, hence my rating. I might have wished to give it one star, but it did entertain me by how bad it was.

       "  'reviewText': 'One need go no further than the title of the book, dervied from the French verb \"assommer\"- to beat down, to understand that this will be a brutally and painfully realistic work. Zola is true to this expectation.  Emile Zola had a thunderous impact on both nineteenth century French  literature and political culture. Not only did he decry blatant injustice  through his works, but to a large extent, he sacrificed his livelihood in  espousing the cause of Captain Dreyfus through his tract  \"J\\'accuse!\". Zola\\'s sincere moral beliefs will surprise no one  who has read his works. The passion with which the novels that comprise the  Rougon series are written is a rarity. Having read five or six of these  novels, I find that the charcter of Gervaise in L\\'Assomoir is both the most  real and the most endearing. As opposed to Nana who is often perceived by  readers as cold and merciless, Gervaise is a simple, hard-working woman who  suffers a tourmented life. Zola\\'s classic naturalist descriptions of the  bars and the consumption of absinthe are priceless. In fact, Gervaise\\'s  suffering almost (but not quite)enables us to justify the actions of her  daughter Nana in the subsequent book of the series. For anyone who is  interested in sampling Zola\\'s mastery and sincere passion, this book is a  must read.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Michael Vey is just another teenager with Tourette's syndrome trying to live a normal life while harboring a secret.  He can generate electricity, but instead of showing off his electrical power he is forced to go into hiding with his mom.  His best friend, Ostin, is the smartest kid in school and together they end up befriending Taylor, the popular cheerleader who has a secret of her own.  The three of them work together to fend off bullies, get out of detention, rescue Michael's mom after she goes missing, and uncover an 12 year old conspiracy led by psychopath Dr. Hatch.\\n\\nWhen I was reading this I kept thinking of Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan.  There are many similarities of the two stories.  Even though Michael isn't a demi god, he still harbors power and leadership abilities; he goes on an impossible adventure with his two friends; and he must discover the truth of his birth and boundaries of his power all while trying to rescue his mom.  His biggest fear is his mom getting killed and his friends getting hurt.  The reason for his electrical abilities is from an experiment that goes wrong when he is born.\\n\\nOne of the themes in this story is bullies.  Everyone has been bullied at some point in their lives and Michael is constantly dealing with them while holding back his power.  One day he finally snaps and loses control which is when the story changes; doing the right thing becomes a bigger challenge when you're being mocked, coerced, threatened or manipulated against your will.  However, when Michael is up against the greatest odds that is when he discovers his true strength and the unrelenting loyalty of his friends.\\n\\nThis story is divided up into four parts and Michael doesn't experience Cell 25 until almost the end of the book.  This is such a great story and a safe read that's engrossing, humorous, touching, and electrifying!  There is violence in the story because of the electrical powers so lots of people get zapped, but there is nothing graphic or inappropriate.  I recommend this to those who enjoyed Percy Jackson or just enjoy Young Adult novels.  Mine was a library copy and I learned that the sequel to this book is due in August 2012.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'These are undoubtedly exciting times to work in the field of mens studies, and especially at the intersections of interdisciplinary research in gender studies and the biomedical sciences. Genaro Castro-Vzquezs Male Circumcision in Japan (2015) represents an extraordinary work of ethnographic research on male circumcision within the space of Japan. More specifically, Castro-Vzquezs study attends to adult men who choose to be circumcised. Analyses carefully look at sexuality, gender, and bodily aesthetics, as well as the iews of urologists in Japan on the rise of circumcision. All in all, this book is a real gem, one that fascinates, and one that provokes a range of interesting questions, especially in our historical moment in which we witness the rise of anti-circumcision activism, ever shifting positions within medical associations about routine neonatal circumcision, and discussions around voluntary male circumcision as a prophylactic. In many ways, Castro-Vzquezs book may well participate in more discussions than it had initially proposed, for it seems to me that this book is incredibly valuable when thinking about the deep-seated anxieties surrounding masculinity and the penis, and more particularly what we might call the goodlooking penis. This book, while certainly narrowly focused, has a role to play in a growing number of debates involving masculinity, the penis (cut and uncut), health and aesthetics. This volume draws on Foucaults concept of technology of the self, arguing that Circumcision in Japan is commercialized as a technology of the self that allegedly conveys a method to regain control over the male body and, by extension, to dominate the female one (p. 13, italics in original). Castro-Vzquezs book moves discussion importantly beyond the seemingly normative debate, at least within the North American context, addressing the health benefits and costs of circumcision, towards discussions of gender, culture, sexuality, and interpersonal relations. Castro-Vzquez thus reframes the circumcision debate to consider how the penis, circumcised or uncircumcised, exists in cultural, sexual, and gendered terms. Castro-Vzquez argues throughout his book that removing the prepuce is mostly a practice grounded in cultural and social concerns rather than medical knowledge, at least in Japan (p. 14).\\nThe book is divided into six chapters, the first two of which focus on establishing context and framework, with subsequent chapters drawing from interviews with a group of Japanese men, Japanese women, Japanese urologists and cosmetic surgeons, and a concluding chapter on parents of at least one male offspring (p. 150). In each of these chapters, we hear from a range of informants who speak to and about the penis, often with great difficulty, as noted by Castro-Vzquez: my conversations with the interviewees were not an easy task because of language availability and a culture of silence and pretense that tends to prevent open discussions about the genitals (p. 66). The language surrounding the penis and more particularly circumcision is, at times, difficult, complicated, slippery, and uncertain, whether it be the various terms available in Japanese, or reflecting discomfort with speaking about sexual matters.\\nUnsurprisingly, when we reach a chapter on the medical profession, we are greeted by polar extremes in which the debate was vividly reflected in the interviews because urologists completely opposed the surgical procedure, while cosmetic surgeons supported it (p. 122). Of course, as readers of this journal may appreciate, debates around circumcision are often at incredible oddspro or con, and there is hardly room for a middle ground. The opening epigraphs of this chapter speak to this debate. In the opinion of Dr. Ishi, urologist, circumcision is a form of mutilation of the male body and should be prevented; contra Dr. Takenaka, cosmetic surgeon: Having the foreskin removed means, somehow, for some men, happiness, confidence and willingness to live (p. 121). These opinions, remarkably different, speak to a growing Japanese debate about penile improvements and the perfect penis (p. 137).\\nIf something is missing, perhaps, from this magnificent book, it is a sustained psychological discussion of circumcision. What are the psychological implications of circumcision, especially in adulthood? While not insisting on a psychoanalytic study, for instance, I am interested in whether or not discussions of this have moved to attend to the psychological wellbeing of patients. However, we are told by a urologist that psychological therapy is rare and still a stigmatized practice in Japan. Not many people want to be seen going for mental health services, which on the other hand, are still expensive (p. 143).\\nMale Circumcision in Japan is a fascinatingly rich study that continues to reward its reader because of the ways it provides and affords nuance to debates not just over circumcision, but also masculinity, sexuality, and the penis. In many ways, while this study is about Japan, it is also a study that can help to inform methodological and theoretical discussions of the penis, foreskin, and circumcision in a range of contexts precisely because Castro-Vzquez argues that circumcision is not just a medical procedure, but one that affects and informs gender, sexuality, beauty and aesthetics, culture, psychology and the technology of the self. A most welcome addition to scholarship on sexuality, mens studies, and gender, that will hopefully inform debates about circumcision and the penis and remind us to look not just at the known medical correlates but also at the full range of cultural dimensions and intersections.\\nJONATHAN A.

I have been practicing MI for many years and I am so impressed with the way Bill and Stephen have kept the material fresh and up to date.  In this edition, they add a new paradigm for understanding how to tailor your skills (the 4 processes) to the relationship you are developing with the person considering change.  Also, they consider MI from a multicultural perspective, offering acknowledge and suggestions about how MI may at times need to be tailored to the person receiving this empathic conversation.  Having read all 3 editions, this one is by far the most approachable and easily understood.  They update the research on MI and include copious suggestions around learning MI and applying it to various settings and approaches.  MI is not a therapeutic technique, it is a way of being, and embracing the values and spirit of MI will change your life for the better, giving you the tools and way of thinking to be a kinder, more gentle, and compassionate human being.

       "  'reviewText': \"NO SPOILERS\\n\\nI've read the first four of the John Corey series, and I'm going to post this on each of them.  Apologies if you encounter it multiple times.\\n\\nI've read each of the first four Corey novels straight through in short order, so let there be no doubt -- I like them a lot. Recommend them for you millions of crime and suspense readers out there. The writing is better than average.  The characters are strong.  The plots are very good -- not Stephen Hunter or Lee Child good, but very good.  Good suspense.  Not a lot of action, but enough.\\n\\nSo why not five stars?  Two reasons -- again, not reasons not to read these novels, but things that I wish were different.\\n\\n(1) John Corey is a wiseguy.  No, not a Ray Liotta wiseguy, a wisecracking wiseguy.  But DeMille suffers from the dread Robert Crais Disease exhibited in the Elvis Cole novels.  He thinks he's funny and, while he's funnier than Elvis Cole (and unlike Elvis, is not constantly telling you what a riot he is), he never, ever, stops cracking wise, and far too often it brings the narrative to a screeching, and unfunny, halt.\\n\\n(2) Related problem -- DeMille is so busy showcasing Corey's self-imagined wittiness that sometimes it takes an eternity for the narrative to get anything said.  Lots of domestic scenes with Mrs. Corey that do not move the plot at all, but are there for the two of them to engage in marital sparring.  But that is only a subset of the larger problem, which is that there is a tremendous amount of unnecessary dialogue and explanation and recap and repetition and there are too many really, really, slow spots in these novels.  Unlike the top tier of masters of the genre, these John Corey books invite skimming.\\n\\nBottom line -- these books were in serious need of editing.\\n\\nHaving said this:  Loved 'em all, and in the middle of one now.  What's good about the Corey books is real darned good, and I commend them to you.  But you'll soon learn where to start skimming, and if you self-edit you'll probably like them enough to give them an additional star.\",\n",

I would happily read another of Pessl's books comprised wholly of bullet pointed metaphors and similes - they are that good. She certainly gives a lesson in how to unchain your mind from the confines of convention when it comes to description.\\n\\nI give it 4 stars, as opposed to 5, for two reasons: 1) there was a glaring spelling error in the last 1/3 of the book, which actually made me look around my empty room in hopes someone else would be there to verify what I was seeing. And 2) I hated Blue. I really did. She reminded me WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too much of Lee Fiora in Curtis Sittenfeld's _Prep_, whom I wanted to stab with a thousand blades of fiery fury. If a character is that smart, that engaging intellectually - is it SO hard to have them say at least a FEW words out loud? At times, mainly towards the end, I just wanted to shake Blue until her teeth fell out.\\n\\nThat being said, I am truly in love with this book. Fin.\",\n",

Claire, a widow, had to get out of Baltimore, where her fourteen year old son was hanging out with the wrong crowd, and getting into more and more trouble. Dr. Elliot was determined to start a new life in Tranquility, taking over the only medical practice in Town. The only problem was the residents still treated her like an outsider and were reluctant to go to her, eight months after her momentous decision. It does not help her practice that someone is sending those who come to see her warning notes to stay away. She is the only one willing to treat Warren Emerson, the local outcast. Her son Noah wants desperately to go back to Baltimore. However things get better for him when he becomes friends with Amelia Reid. The Reids live in tragic circumstances and meet a tragic end.  At school, Taylor Darnell goes on a bloody rampage in his biology class enraged over a bad grade. Soon after, Scott Braxton attacks his family and kills his mother. The Local Emergency room is filled to capacity. When her own son starts to exhibit abnormal rage, Claire is desperate to find the answer. She enrages the community itself when she tries to blame Locust Lake as the cause for all the trouble. Her only defender is Lincoln Kelly, the Police chief. Reporters far and wide, want to report on the events happening in Tranquility. With some research at the local newspaper archives, and persistent determination, Claire manages to reveal the truth.',\n",

In That Touch of Ink, Madison has had a few months to recover from the excitement a dead body and a snippet of film with a message from her  ex, Brad,brought to her life.  When she receives a $5000 bill in the mail, a whole new mystery emerges from Madisons past.  I liked the more tightly written story this time, we already know about Madisons retro business and bum knee and don't have to go over that ground as much as in the first novel.  However, I still appreciated Valleres clever nods to the Doris Day movies Madison loves so much, tucked into the names of characters and the planning of an atomic kitchen for new clients that have become some of the new friends Madison sorely needs in Dallas.  Madison proves to be a very strong heroine, although at times I wish she would accept some of the help that is offered. That  makes the series exceed the parameters of a regular cozy and into a very complex story that involves a mystery and how one woman is able to truly begin again.  I am definitely looking forward to the next  Madison Night novel.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'A book is just that: constrained within the parameters of its own pages...so it can\\'t and doesn\\'t address every possible perspective and theory on the subject, and I feel, as another critical reviewer mentioned, that Marylou relies way too heavily on the subjective information obtained through her interviews of gifted adults.  As others have mentioned, she points out some of the problems of being a gifted adult, which may be refreshing for some (in terms of acknowledging what they experience on a daily basis), but woefully inadequate for anyone that wants potential strategies (or for some answers vs. strategies) for coping with a world that is largely not built to accommodate someone that\\'s brilliant.  Marylou does make some good points for \"outsiders\" who wish to understand what it\\'s like to have someone gifted in their lives, but for someone that\\'s already indoctrinated and/or someone that\\'s been living as a gifted person, this book has little to nothing to offer that you don\\'t already know.  I also was surprised on the chapter that discusses the \"darker\" aspects of the gifted that it was so heavily focused on incarcerated individuals...to me this seemed like her most sensationalized chapter: the focus on the \"sociopath\".  I was pretty disgusted by this, in my opinion, blatant foray into a \"hook the general audience topic\" (cool! Sociopathy!...brilliant people that \"went crazy\"!); I would\\'ve much preferred a more well rounded approach: the socio-economic, the psychological, the social, and other aspects that can be severely impaired from/or concerning one\\'s high intelligence level.  To give her credit, she does touch on these some elsewhere in the book, but it would\\'ve made more sense to include them all in the \"dark side\" chapter.  I will give her book 2 stars vs. 1 because this is such a poorly studied topic and she clearly put in the effort to research this and publish her findings and theories, but its age, and therefore inherent irrelevancy to 2016, is showing.  I wish she would\\'ve created a follow up book that further studied the field, or I wish one of her colleagues would have picked up her mantle.  So I walk away largely frustrated by Marylou\\'s work because it is far from completed...it feels like this was merely a starting point....but then it has largely gone nowhere in almost 20 years...it further confirms that gifted adults aren\\'t considered something of interest in fields of study.  It further serves to reinforce isolation.',\n",

If you feel the need to have two, then add Don Anslet\\'s \"Clutter\\'s Last Stand\" and you\\'re all set. \"Sink Reflections\" transformed our home and I sure wish I had read it YEARS ago. Ya know what? It doesn\\'t really take that much time to keep a tidy house IF you know what you\\'re doing & you stay on task, and that\\'s where this book comes in. I love her philosophy of \"Blessing\" a home by cleaning it. That concept totally changed how I view housework and chores. I used to think cleaning was thankless and annoying; now I see that it\\'s a way to show love for my family and appreciation for my home.\\n\\nGreat plan for every area of a home and lots of motivation to get up and get going. This book is all business, but funny as well. It isn\\'t a quick fix -it\\'s a realistic and supportive approach to getting organized and staying that way.\\n\\nI marked sections of the book for later reference and keep it handy. The book includes short commentaries and examples from folks who use her approach, which are very motivational to read. Best tip EVER: using a timer when cleaning a room. It\\'s surprising how much can be accomplished in only 10 minutes when you stay on task. This book won\\'t disappoint; if you\\'re looking to have a tidy, organized, pleasant home this is THE book to have. You\\'ll love your home!!!',\n",

Living in an area full of wineries, I was also interested in the setting.\\n\\nI very much enjoyed this book. West quickly established the relationship between Natalie and her parents, then got on with the story. West hinted at issues from Natalie's past, but she didn't make me wait until halfway through the story to show what had happened (a pet peeve of mine).\\n\\nOne thing I really appreciated about the story was the complexity of the characters and plot. The main characters were likable, but flawed. While the romance was a key theme, it wasn't the only thing going on - the characters had some serious issues to work through and accept. While it did feel like some of the issues wrapped up quickly and easily and the end, I liked the dept of the situations and the characters.\\n\\nA fun read. Perfect for relaxing on the beach this summer. If you're a fan of Denise Hunter, you'll like Catherine West.\\n\\n*I received a free copy of this book. The opinion is my own.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"While Will's POV from Slammed isn't necessary to perpetuate my sheer love for this series by Colleen Hoover, especially since Point of Retreat was from his POV, I will not deny my utter excitement at getting another book from Colleen featuring Will and Lake. Book retellings can be a tricky business and are not always done right. I'm not a fan of simply cutting and pasting previous scenes and then just reconfiguring things to change the speaker/voice. This is where Colleen Hoover got everything right. This novel, for me, was the perfect retelling of a story from another character's POV, and Will is the perfect narrator.\\n\\nWhat makes THIS GIRL so special and unique?\\n\\n1. We get not only Will's POV from Slammed, but we additionally get his POV while he and Lake are on their honeymoon. So we get the past and present mixed together. It's basically a story within a story. This could not have been done better.\\n\\n2. We get Will's POV during the scenes with him and Lake during Slammed. But Colleen didn't fall into the old 'cut-and-paste' method with a few internal thoughts thrown in here and there. We get a full immersion into Will's psyche and truly get to see each situation from his deep POV, no stone unturned. Additionally, I loved the interactions between Will and Lake after he would tell her each mini-story and how together they would reflect on the different ways they saw each situation and how they were able to come together, understanding the other a little bit better after seeing the other side of the story.\\n\\n3. We get lots of bonus material about Will himself: who he was before Lake, what happened with him while Lake wasn't around, how much he was dedicated to her during those really difficult times, his relationship with Julia, his relationship with Caulder and Kel, his relationship with Gavin. All of these things made me fall in love with Will over and over again.\\n\\n4. We get new honeymoon scenes that prove how compatible and wonderful Will and Lake are together. While it is obvious they are on their honeymoon having sex (refer to Kiersten's definition), there is nothing overly steamy or graphic, and any sex scenes eventually go fade to black, so the audience for this book remains consistent with the audience for Slammed and Point of Retreat.\\n\\n5. We get more slam poetry!! Including beautiful slams from Will!!\\n\\n6. We get a beautiful, heartfelt, poignant, and perfect epilogue. You will rejoice with Will and Lake and their future, and the beauty of their life together. You will swoon over Will all over again. And Colleen somehow was able to involve all the pertinent players from the books into the epilogue. Girlfriend knows how to leave her readers happy!\\n\\nBottomline: This is the perfect bonus ending to the Slammed series. I will miss journeying with Will and Lake into their future, but their future is bright and my thoughts for them will forever be happy. This is a series I will read over and over, and Will's POV is the metaphorical cherry on top. Thank you, Colleen, for your writing genius!\",\n",

Mark is using multiple methods to require the reader to immediately practice the lesson demonstrated in the text.  Some books provide code samples, but unless the reader goes and uses those examples to set them into their gray matter, they can be easily forgotten.  If I can make two small criticisms of the content:\\n1. The material is spoon fed.  I think a little more information could be conveyed in each chapter - most chapters are only about two pages long.\\n2. The online practice questions that require the reader to drag words and punctuation onto a tableau seems slow and tedious, particularly on a laptop.  There may be a cognitive benefit to that tool, but I found it more annoying than helpful.

I also enjoy the vast repertoire of material presented throughout the book.  The material ranges from focused studies to actual songs, encompassing nearly every genre imaginable, from classical to folk.  Many of these songs are famous, others are slightly more obscure, but each cleverly selected to introduce a new element or concept at precisely the right time.  The variety of music selection has also expanded the future directions that I hope to take my violin playing.\\n  I also highly recommend acquiring the accompanying CD.

       "  'reviewText': \"Imagine a gentle tale about friendship, magic, and adventure.  Throw in not-too-scary meanies and cute fairy creatures.  There you have author Jaime Lee Manns fantasy for early- and middle-grade readers, Elora of Stone: Legend of Rhyme Series (Vol. 1, Book 1).\\n\\nNarrative\\nMann delivers a multi-generational saga built on themes of friendship and love between two families, who live in the tiny kingdom of Falmoor.  Their world is plagued by the disappearance of children, specifically the loss of one child from a pair of twins.  (While this sounds frightening, the story eventually provides an explanation that is not upsetting.)  The plot introduces magic elements to keep the families from harm for the first part of the tale.  The ending offers surprising twists (no spoilers here!) that will make young readers pause and think.  Mann leaves just enough suspense and loose endings for readers to be eager to pick up the next book in her series, Into Coraira.\\n\\nCharacters\\nThe first generation of protagonists, Gwendolyn and Lochlan, are entwined by magic.  They are betrothed to each other at an early age in an arranged marriage that their parents hope will protect the young couple as adults from an evil that wraps Falmoor.  I become fond of these characters as the writer fleshes out their personalities and tells of a sweet courtship.  The story skips ahead to find the two wed and parents of twins uh-oh! You know how the citizens of Falmoor guard against fight evil to keep their children safe.  However, this is not done in a scary fashion.\\n\\nElora, the witchy titular character, is a multi-layered personality, who keeps children hooked as Mann unravels her secrets.  She is ably assisted by her minion, Gimblerod, as a grouchy gremlin children will love to hate.  Cinnamon and Sibley delight as sweet fairies.\\n\\nSince I read the book in several sittings, it took a moment to adjust when new characters are introduced in the second half of the tale.  The dialogue also shifts from third-person to first-person voice as the author introduces Gwendolyns and Lochlans children.  A character list or graphic organizer would be helpful, especially as the series evolves, to enable readers to keep track.\\n\\nFormat, Illustrations\\nEven though e-books allow for adjusting font size and paragraph spacing, the native layout of the digital book on my tablet marks Elora of Stone as another example of the books appeal for children.  There is enough white space on the page, so they will not feel overwhelmed by too much text.  Chapters are short, and they often include black-and-white drawings to enhance comprehension and keep kids engaged.\\n\\nThe cover design is especially appealing.  Its misty yellow-and-green swirls draw me in, and the teeny frog in the corner makes me want to know how it figures into the story.\\n\\nUnique Features\\nThis book is an excellent way to introduce fantasy/adventure to beginning readers and hook reluctant readers.  It's the first book of a series, which is a sure-fire way to attract children who will want to follow the adventures in The Legend of Rime.\\n\\nRecommendation\\nI highly recommend Elora of Stone, especially for beginning and reluctant readers.  Its an epic fantasy for pint-sized readers.  Children will root for its heroes and hiss the villains, but they won't be frightened as they wait for more.\",\n",

The book helps you to see life too closely and tells you as to what life is all about. It makes you aware of the very  fact that nothing is real and the life is just a dream. Richard Bach's meet  with the Messiah was to teach him lessons so he too could  become one. The  power of believing is what one needs during a lifetime,if one can learn  that nothing remains impossible. The book tells you that every problem comes  with a gift in hand and we ask for problems because we need their gifts,and  Bach in his book shows that very well. The book is worth reading a thousand  times and for especially those who like to live in an illusionary  world.....\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I got this book for free, as Im sure many others did during the promo. I was looking forward to it as I had heard about the book ages ago. There are only 17 reviews as I write this and I assume that is because people are being nice and will only write positive reviews, I often do that but this time I read that the authors wanted constructive feedback, so my 2 star review is for that purpose only. I read alot, mostly post apocalyptic fiction, your book did not give me anything to hook onto. The rush to the action, within the first few pages it seemed, gave me no set up, no character to like or root for. If you had taken a couple of chapters to describe life in the castles, introduce me to a few people there, make me care, this would have been a great story. Why would I care about the 10,000 they are trying to save if I don't know that they are worth it. What if that 10,000 were the rapists and evils left after an apocalypse, I wouldnt care if they lived. If you had given me a family, gave them a dog or something , then switched back and forth between the plant and the town, I would of become more invested in the outcome. To be honest, I felt so little care I didn't finish the book. I never do this, I only have 9 books in the category of crap on my kindle, those are the ones I can't finish. So for next time, a back story is as important as the action. Great concept, my mind went wild with the idea of a massive horde, just too bad I didn't care. Thank you for reading this in the vein it was written, constructive feedback. Try again and I will read it for sure!!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This book is a trainwreck.\\n\\nNot a supernatural tragedy with darn near no survivors. Well, actually, it might be exactly that.\\n\\nBut it is a good book and a fun read. Boomer\\'s protagonist Royden Poole is hysterically irreverent and self-deprecating. A few of the characters serve to play to classic tropes, like the perpetually cynical and irritated police detective, who knows Poole\\'s supernatural lifestyle, but still insists on pursuing him for an impossible murder. Most of the cast, however, is an amalgam of spiritual beings with alien demeanors - vestiges of historical kingdoms who manifest the totemic power of varying cultures and beliefs. That\\'s why I say train wreck. \"The Hole Behind Midnight\" features an entertaining mashup of pulp culture references, obscure history, and classical literature. It\\'s a smart enough read to forgive the occasional feeling that the author is going out of his way to make it a smart read. But those details process quickly, and help set the landscape of an original world that hasn\\'t been developed before.\\n\\nMy favorite part of the book is Poole. There\\'s no denying the anti-hero\\'s voice plays to the gumshoe trope, as if Douglas Adams and Micky Spillane were run through a supercollider together and came out just super pissed. However, Poole\\'s voice honors the schtick without being derivative. You know very early that Royden Poole\\'s life is going to get progressively worse, and you willingly go along for the ride without feeling you\\'ve read this book before. It\\'s all brand new, the characters, the world, its unique (but intuitive) system for magic - all make the book a fast-paced adventure best characterized as full-frontal nerdity. Literally.\\n\\nWhich brings me to my only real criticism of the novel. This content, particularly about two-thirds in, pushes the envelope of my tolerance for gratuitous profanity and sexual themes. I am more relaxed on violence, or counter cultural references like drug use (and there\\'s plenty of both of those), but Boomer sets a pretty cinematic stage. In Hole Behind Midnight, I found myself trying to un-visualize things. If you\\'re moderately conservative about such content, or have ever been described as prude, read the book with a bit of warning. It\\'s going to take you places you (hopefully) have never been before.\\nWith that caveat (fairly old news by now), I strongly recommend the book. Poole is fun and memorable, and I really care about what happens to him and his friend Cleon. If you can suspend enough disbelief to not be nothered by the mature themes, you\\'ll thoroughly enjoy the book and respect its author for the depth of his research and the originality of the universe he\\'s helping create. If you are less guarded about weird sex and blasphemous profanity than I am, you\\'re robbing yourself by not reading this book instead of its review. \"The Hole Behind Midnight\", and its fun cast of characters, is a fast dose of pulp fiction, and I\\'m down for the sequel.',\n",

This is not the reality for the vast majority of today's unemployed! She does deal with the loss of identity one experiences after losing a job and the emptiness of too many unfilled hours in a day,  but is already working her way out of this by the FIFTH day of her unemployment and, indeed, all of her challenges are resolved by her 32nd day of unemployment! Really? Although I wish it were, this is not the reality of unemployment and I was very disappointed to see what has been for me and many others a traumatic experience treated so lightly.

It was a really neat thing to be involved in. Thanks again for the opportunity, Casey.\\n\\nI would give this book 3.5 Stars.\\n\\nI really enjoyed this book. I received it right after Thanksgiving and loved having a light, funny, sweet, and a little steamy story to read after the weekend. This story does have insta-love, but I enjoyed it so much that I didn't care. Also, I honestly bought into it in the beginning, especially on Rachel's part. I can see a teenage girl dreaming about an older, hot guy for three years after spending a day with him like Rachel spent with Colin. All in all, it was a sweet love story. It was funny and had some really loveable characters, such as Rachel's assistant / bf, Gretchen and all of Colin's friends who followed him around until he found what he needed to buy and then found Rachel. So sweet! I will definitely read the rest of the series.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I can honestly say that I enjoyed Gallaghers Hope just as much as I enjoyed Gallaghers Pride. This book continues the story of Ethan, Gabriel, Eliza, and Brenna (who I loved) and introduces us to Isabel Rousseau and her brother, Andrewonly this time the story takes on the perspective of Gabriel and Isabelle.\\n\\nIsabelle is brought into the Gallagher clan in much the same way as Brenna was  these men LOVE to collect women in trouble! In both occasions, I had to slightly suspend belief that these women would so quickly and easily go with these men when they were newly arrived in town, but I was willing to do so because I enjoy the authors writing style and the nature of the story being told. Andrew adds a needed light-hearted childrens perspective when there are many heavier moments that the Gallaghers et al experience in this tale.\\n\\nWhile there is some light romance (no bodice ripper here!), the development of that romance occurs naturally within the confines of a story of a family in the west; at times it takes precedence, but at others it steps back and lets the action scenes take over. I think it is the perfect balance of romance, action, hardscrabble life in the west, and heartwarming family story.\\n\\nMy only small qualm is that there is one scene early on when Isabelle is brought to Hawks Peak that is basically a direct overlap from a scene toward the end of Gallaghers Pride, except that it is seen from the perspective of Gabriel and Isabelle rather than Ethan and Brenna. And while this served well to tie the timeline and progression of the two stories together, the fact that I read these stories back to back made it feel extremely repetitive.\\n\\nI listened to this as an audiobook: My thoughts on the narration of this book are fairly similar to those of Gallaghers Pride - I don't think that a more perfect narrator could have been found for this book. I just absolutely loved his narration! It felt so true to the characters and story being told. His voice is so smooth with just a touch of drawl that was perfect for the setting of the book. So, not only did the characters and story suck me in, but the narration was the icing on the cake. Loved, loved loved!!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': '** spoiler alert ** I enjoyed this one. James Patterson definitely keeps me in the suspense and mystery. This one was a very graphic and disturbing serial killer, in fact it turns out to be a duo of serial killers. Alex\\'s newest case hits very close to home when his own niece ends up disappearing so he heads out of LA to find her. Since he\\'s not on home turf, we don\\'t see very much of his partner or the rest of the department this time around. The case begins to open up a little as one of the serial killers victims escapes, and gives some details and clues leading Alex around. He agrees to partner with the FBI to get more info and resources on this wild chase.\\n\\nI liked Alex Cross a little better in this one than his first. However, if you\\'ve seen the movie if might not mesh in your mind. It didn\\'t for me. While Morgan Freeman is an amazing actor, and I feel he plays his part well in the movie, he doesn\\'t match the gorgeous romantic raising his family in the \\'hood. I loved Kate, she\\'s fiery and determined. Both characters are written maybe a little too perfectly, but I read this book for the mystery and suspense, not for the character building and definitely not the romance. Once Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd were cast in my mind, the romance absolutely did not work.\\n\\nThe serial killers were incredibly disturbing. There are parts that you perhaps want to skip, or breeze over if you don\\'t want the gory details. I would only recommend this for fans of fictional serial killer rapists. There is some pretty nasty sadism involved. I did like the idea of dual serial killers, two sinister men meet and then begin \"twinning.\" One moves across the country and we find our protag battling two coast-to-coast serial killers sharing each other\\'s conquests.\\n\\nThis one was full of twists and turns. The beginning, where he\\'s living in the wall hooked me. That right there could\\'ve made a great serial killer book all on it\\'s own, but it\\'s a very brief section. It keeps you hoping from person to person, murder to crime scene, very fast paced. This is one of those books I like to read quickly so I\\'m not thinking about it night after night. The movie and book are quite a bit different from one another, I would read the book first if possible. Definitely an adult who can handle some graphic violence only read. I do feel the need to find myself a nice young adult fantasy for a bit to put my mind in a happy place.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': '\"Deliver us from evil\" quite appropriately takes its title from the last line of the \"Lord\\'s Prayer\" as the 9/11 tragedy sent Americans to church in numbers not seen in a generation.  Unfortunately, those who hate God and believe that the United States is to blame for the problems of the world can\\'t seem to handle the basic truth that this, and other books present.\\n\\nGranted, this book is not the most scholarly work on the market, however, it presents the truth.  It presents clear arguments augmented by facts that are well research and well documented.  However, many liberals who have \"reviewed\" this book obviously miss the point.\\n\\nOne instance is the claim that Bush41 should be responsible for the first World Trade Center attack if Clinton is to be held responsible for the second.  However, there is big difference between the two.  The terrorists were relatively quiet during the first Bush administration, so there was no reason to focus on this, especially as the Cold War was coming to a close during his tenure and there was the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, which HE SUCCESSFULLY addressed.  Clinton endured eight years of terrorist attacks and did little to stop it.  The liberals fail to make their point, and in fact actually show their ignorance as well as their desparation to defend a president best known for appeasement.\\n\\nAnother area has to do with Carter\\'s appeasement to Islamic fundamentalists.  He failed to adequately support the Shah of Iran.  Sure, he wasn\\'t the nicest guy in the world, BUT look at what followed.  Unfortunately, as a consequence, the Reagan administration had to clean up this, as well as a number of other messes created by Carter (Iran, Panama, oil, Taiwan, among others.)\\n\\nThe comparisons between Democrats of today and Democrats of the Truman-JFK years is stark and poignant.  Democrats don\\'t like that because they like to the claim the legacy of these two men.  However, they would not even recognize the Democratic Party of today as the party they once led to electoral success for decades.\\n\\nIt is clear that Democrats have NOT been strong supporters of freedom around the world, or even in the United States.  Sean Hannity simply brings this to the fore.  Liberals complain that he is unfairly targeting them.  Well, he is targeting them, but it is hardly unfair.  Read this book AND check the footnotes (they check out) before judging this book.  THEN judge it on its merits.  I didn\\'t give it a five because it is not the most sophisiticated read, but unlike may liberal books I have read, it is both truthful and well-documented.',\n",

His numbers are falling and he needs an image reconstruction.  His past is keeping him from getting the momentum that will take him to Congress.  On the other side of town, Luci is running a home for teenage girls.  She is in desperate need of funding so she can keep her girls home running.\\nBy a chance meeting, Alex and Luci meet and come up with a plan to get public opinion on his side and the funding desperately needed  for Luci\\'s home.  The plan seems risky because it involves so many lies and pretense.\\nThis is a fun light read.  Because it\\'s from a Christian publisher, there is no real scandal or questionable material. Its basic plot line can be boiled down to rich boy meets poor girl.

Entering the service too young (so he could help provide for his fellow orphan siblings), rejected by the Marines and the Navy as being too wimpy looking, serving in WW2 for only about 2 years, and still earning every US award for combat valor (several of them multiple times),  as well as French and Belgian awards for valor, America's enemies were probably very thankful Audie Murphy was not born a few years earlier.  If he had been born in 1922 instead of 1925 (or 1926 depending on whose story one believes), their butts would have been in a sling within a few weeks after Pearl Harbor, before they could have even gotten a foothold anywhere.  He was a very kind-hearted young man with the unique ability to perform heroic acts of single-handed mass destruction in the most adverse of conditions.  Several rifle companies of Germans and 5 battle tanks?  No problem when you have one Audie Murphy and one disabled, burning piece of US hardware with a machine gun on it.  Truly, Audie Murphy was a walking self-contradiction, quietly describing himself as just another dogface, which is why he wanted his grave in Arlington Cemetery to look no different from anyone else's.  Yet, his is the second most visited gravesite, after JFK's.  Awesome movie, and it should have had 3 or 4 times the budget, to catapult it into being the panoramic epic the man deserved.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This is the second of George MacDonald\\'s three books featuring an Anglican parish out in the English countryside, and its curate, Thomas Wingfold.  As such, this title is the sequel to \"The Curate\\'s Awakening\", in the Phillips abridgment, or \"Thomas Wingfold, Curate,\" in George MacDonald\\'s full-length original.\\n\\nThese novels I mostly prefer in abridgment, and that goes double for \"The Lady\\'s Confession\"/\"Paul Faber, Surgeon.\"  Phillips, in this edition, is actually quite sensitive to the religious, moral, theological issues aired by MacDonald in this plot; so, although MacDonald\\'s preachy asides are trimmed down, they are not completely cut away, but rendered a little more succinct. In this particular series of novels, this is a good thing.\\n\\nFor your information, the big removed chunk that you are missing here, is an anti-vivisectionist rant, shoved down the readers\\' collective throats as a Sunday sermon commenting on the scripture about God seeing the fall of the sparrow.  I don\\'t miss it at all.  If you want to read it, you will not find it in this edition with this title -- you must look in \"Paul Faber, Surgeon\" instead. And you are welcome to it.\\n\\nThe story is one of MacDonald\\'s more ambiguous tales, with some characters who are as good as they are wicked, not just saints versus sinners.  Although, this book does have at least one saint in it, but so as not to spoil it, I won\\'t say which character this is.  The treatment of women might irk some readers.\\n\\nI especially enjoyed the story arc in which Reverend Thomas Wingfold enjoys family life with his wife Helen, and their little son whose name I already forget.',\n",

Most of them I do not like because I feel that those authors want to write about their sex life, and then fill in the rest of the story with some kind of a plot. I usually cannot even finish those. I felt that this story was different.  I liked how Darcy was portrayed in this story.  It was how I imagined him to be.  I could not rate this story 5 stars because the subplot regarding Georgiana taking off without remorse didn't seem to fit in with her character, even in this story.  Several new characters were introduced which kept the storyline varied and interesting.  I felt the author did a good  job tying the subplots together.  When I first read this story 5 years ago, I had just discovered Jane Austen, and I was only interested in reading about Darcy and Elizabeth; the subplots bogged the story down for me.

Somehow, in a non-peer reviewed, non-academic setting we are supposed to agree with the idea that prosperity can be positively associated with large numbers of people.  Yet, no one asks then what is the purpose of capital investment as opposed to human investment. No one asks about productivity gains that undermine the necessity for more people.  No one asks the question of why our schools worldwide are producing mindless students who are good at doing what they are told but very weak in asking important questions.  Last and most important, the very title itself runs counter to history and to reality.  It's a fact that prosperity has been generated by a few independent minds and taken advantage of by hoardes of free riders.  Look at Jobs/Woziniak, the IBM paper on relational databases, Newton/Leibniz, Gauss, Plunkett of Teflon fame, Goodyear - Rubber, Goddard -rockets, Mozart, Thoreau, Karamozov, Kilby, von Neuman, Heaviside, Szilard, Shockley, Mandelbrot, Adam Smith..........and so on.\\n\\nQuantity does NOT equal quality.

I tired to force myself to just look things up after I read a whole chapter and that seemed to help a bit but didn't quite solve things for me for some reason.

       "  'reviewText': 'In the Brothers Torres, Frankie Towers comes of age in a small town in New Mexico.  As Frankie juggles high school rivalries, life in his brother\\'s shadow, his parents\\' expectations, and getting a date for homecoming (Rebecca Sanchez!), he takes some big steps into adulthood.\\n\\nVoorhees has a knack for tapping into the moments that mark the transition from youth to maturity, deftly intertwining adolescent concerns with the weightier issues that follow.  He keeps it light with consistent pacing and a punchy, sly sense of humor that entertains without either underestimating the reader or minimizing the import of Frankie\\'s experiences.  The cultural references appearing throughout the book are well-chosen and will stand the test of time.  (Julius Caesar and Star Wars make the cut, while SMS texting and YouTube fortunately do not.)\\n\\nThe novel, Voorhees\\'s first, skillfully covers the genre\\'s standard components (love interest, sibling/peer/parent conflicts, awakening to the complexities of the adult world), and distinguishes itself through its setting in New Mexico.  The venue allows for an exploration of the Latino experience (Frankie is a \"half-breed\" - Anglo father, Latino mother), and the interplay between mixing cultures is increasingly relevant in cities and towns across the country.  Also, descriptions of the desert, tourists, fire ants, mesa parties, and stuffed sopapillas create a robust sense of place, lending depth to the characters and the story.\\n\\nVoorhees hits the nail on the head with Frankie\\'s voice, the dialogue, and the sensibilities of his characters - particularly the students.  In contemporary young-adult fiction, achieving authenticity is as critical as it is difficult.  Readers will not be surprised to learn that Voorhees spent several years teaching high school English.  Clearly it was not just his students who were taking good notes.',\n",

Although I'm fond of Nick, and am interested in his take on things and his personal story, I really felt that it detracted from the Ty/Zane dynamic. I didn't get as much time with them as I'm used to and therefore wasn't able to go as deep with them. I kind of thought the sidewinder series was there to focus on Nick, while the cut & run was for our feisty pair.\\n\\nDon't misunderstand, there are still great Ty/Zane moments. I'm just used to it being all about them. I feel like I was spoiled with 7 books of pure Ty/Zane and now I have to share with Nick and don't wanna haha\\n\\nBut whatever. I read these books to be entertained and I was entertained, so mission accomplished.\\n\\nSo basically I liked it well enough.

And of course, there are the normal business men and women that want to make the house into a nursing home. It sounded like a little kids movie. And it wasn't scary. It would've been a little frightening if it wasn't so predictable- the same thing happened to every character when they entered the house. It got really repetitive. The characters could have been more vibrant, too- the main character was bland and the mom got a little annoying. The only thing I could say for the story was that it was enjoyable to see which exotic character would sneak up on them next!! But overall, I wasn't really crazy about it. It followed a forseeable pattern that needed to be spiced up by some action. Better luck next time!\",\n",

It is very in depth, and very complicated, no word is wasted in this book, hence it cannot, and should not be \\'skimmed\\'. No passage is wasted, there is basically no unneeded character.\\nSecondly, some persons have reviewed this book, and have said something to the effect that everything evil is black, and some have gone so far to say this book is racists towards blacks/Africans, and they are entitled to their opinions, however as I see it, both opinions are against mine.\\nHowever, if any prejudice exists in this book, it is just a little bit, and toward women, but then again, this was written at the turn of the century, and thus was the culture.\\nAnd about the color black, it has been used over and over in history to show evil. But in this book, it isn\\'t as much evil, as it symbolizes the truth, and light symbolizes mankinds devices to be happy, and sometimes this means to aviod the darkness (truth). Main examples of this are african slaves themselves. Ivory is light, and make people happy, the slaves are dark in this book and are the truth behind the ivory. Then in the end when Kurtz dies, he only can see black, even with a candle in his face; when one dies they supposedly see \\'their life flash by\\'. I think Conrad is using this, and Kurtz is seeing the truth (dark) about his life, and cannot see the candle, and mutters his last words \"The Horror... \" A last example of this is when Marlow is speaking with The Intended (Kurtz\\'s fiancee), and lies to her, up to this point, the room is getting darker and darker, and if Marlow were to tell the truth, quite possibly the Intended (her forehead was white, rembemer, because she didn\\'t see the truth about Kurtz) would see the truth, and all light would be gone, and the room would have been pitch black.\\nAnyways, as I said, this IS a masterpiece, it should be read several times, and should be thought about quite seriously.',\n",

I found it to be an excellent, extremely informative and highly-readable book that was hard to put down, and which I read cover-to-cover.  If you're are a technophile, you'll enjoy the amount of detail it provides; if you're a technophobe, you'll appreciate the clear language and the invaluable recommendations of hardware and software.  It's a book that isn't shy about including technical details but that remembers that the ultimate goal is the audio experience.  I also enjoyed the free offer of about a hundred MP3 files.\",\n",

I have read them all in their order, some repeatedly more so than others. It is beyond my mind to imagine that this book could have been more perfect for the series it stands beside and a part of. Often, alternate views of the same story are too redundant, and lack their own story, or the opposite, they do not bridge and connect with the first view. I believe that Orson Scott Card rode the balance between the two ultimates, and Enders Shadow was born into a league that it may occupy alone.\\n\\nA beautiful story, and as always, possessing an incredible insight into the human mind as an individual and as a species. Reading this book can only better the reader, and I recommend it to anyone capable of grasping it\\'s story.\\n\\nI love Julian \"Bean\" Delphiki as much as I love Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin, and both characters hold a place in my heart that few characters from the vast pool of books and stories I have experienced share. Thank you Mr. Card, for this beauty you allowed me to experience and live.',\n",

Pressfield calls these experiences Resistance.  He then tells you what to do about them.\\nYou may not like all of what he has to say or even agree with it, however it will force you to decide what is important to you and above all TO ACT on it!  What ever \"it\" is.  Whether it be writing, painting, or study you don\\'t have to be an artist to benefit from this wisdom and his instruction. As a student, I felt he was speaking directly to me.\\n\\nHere are three things that stuck with me:\\n\"There never was a moment, and never will be, when we are without the power to alter our destiny.  This second, we can turn the tables on Resistance.  This second, we can sit down and do our work.\"\\n\\n\"We have two lives:  the life we live and the unlived life we dream about. Resistance fills the gap in-between.\"\\n\\nThe hard part of sitting down to study -  is not necessary the study itself it is the sitting down part.  \"The battle must be fought a new every day.\"\\n\\nFrom a student that didn\\'t study - but does now.\\n\\nRating: Strong Buy',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'After reading one book which specifically mentions and disagrees with Michael Allen Williams\\' position, (\"No Longer Jews: The Search for Gnostic Origins\" by Smith), I figured that \"Rethinking \\'Gnosticism\\'\" would be an important read.\\n\\nWilliams\\' basic position is that there is not enough evidence to support and maintain the category of \"Gnosticism\", and he proposes a term \"biblical demiurgic tradition\". Throughout the book, Williams systematically addresses central issues that have been cited as making up the Gnostic category, such as Gnostic interpretation, concepts of the body, ethical issues, and so on.\\n\\nI would like to mention a couple of examples where I find Williams\\' discussion lacking. These are only examples, and will precede some good points from \"Rethinking \\'Gnosticism\\'\" as well.\\n\\nFirstly, Williams largely presents the category of Gnosticism in very simplistic terms, claiming that it is presented as \"cliche\" or \"caricatures\" of the religions so categorised. For ethics, Williams presents the ascetic or libertine options as the ones emphasised by previous understandings of Gnosticism. In contrast, while these elements have been discussed by other authors of note, they have not been presented in a way that obscures the complexity of Gnostic ethics in all its range, (a point in reference would be the Valentinians, who were very mild, middle-of-the-road types). In this sense, Williams seems to be shooting at shadows a bit.\\n\\nSecondly, Williams claims that the Gnostics had, at times, a more positive attitude to the body. While there is great complexity and variation among differing Gnostic sects, the basic negative view is fairly consistent. Even the Valentinians take a reasonably negative view to it, though they are relatively mild by Gnostic standards. The apparent positive statements and knowledge Gnostics found \"encoded\" in the body that Williams mentions do not negate this underlying negativity to the material world overall and the body in particular.\\n\\nWhile I disagree with Williams\\' overall position, I still feel that this book has definite value for someone studying Gnosticism\\'s history and controversies. Williams reminds us that we must not get trapped by the \"cliches and caricatures\" that can easily influence our understanding. He does well at reminding the reader of some of the complexities of Gnostic thought.\\n\\nOne aspect I particularly thought Williams handled well was the aspect of asceticism and libertinism. He draws out important details and discusses the evidence in fresh ways. While I do not think the evidence is there to support his position of throwing the category of Gnosticism out of the window, he does make some interesting and strong points in the details. While this is not consistently so, Williams does raise some very good issues.\\n\\nDespite some of the problems I have with Williams\\' overall conclusions, his book is an important contribution to the study of Gnosticism. He has dared rock the boat and get some rethinking going, which is always healthy. I would recommend the book to anyone who seeks an understanding of the problematic side of studying Gnosticism.',\n",

The author highlights the health benefits of a plant-based diet with updated medical advice, and recommendations for a healthy diet. All mouth-watering, flavorful recipes include: The number of servings, simple directions, and helpful tips. There are several inviting, colorful photos that compliment the recipes. Many of the ingredients are common, and several recipes are within a friendly budget.\\n\\nThe Index includes: Breads & Muffins; Breakfast; Salads; Soups & Chillis; Burgers, Sandwiches, And Tacos; Entrees; Side Dishes; And Desserts.\\n\\nSome of the delicious Desserts include: Mint Chocolate Mousse Torte; Peanut Butter Fudge Truffles; And Easy Breezy Sunday Cobbler. We are anxious to make the Coconut Pillows. We made the Creamy Fettuccini, which is simple to make, and very tasty. I have lemons & limes at home, so we made the Lemon-Lime Green Smoothie, which was delicious, and filling. Our Next Selections will be the Creamy Broccoli Soup, The Nacho \"Cheese\" Sauce which my daughter selected, and the Baked Onion Rings. We will leave updates with New recipes we try. Most of the recipes are easy-to-prepare with simple preparation. A Great addition to my cookbook collection at a reasonable price. Highly recommended for all those seeking a healthy diet on a friendly budget. Highly recommended.',\n",

It oozes with witty writing and makes the reader enjoy the art of reading itself.  I know that I may be partial to Mr. Kaufman upon having the opportunity to meet him, but meeting him only confirmed what the book itself is proof of:  That wonderful things do still exist.

Nesbitts POACHER'S MOON is looking for a way to escape, even for a time, the numbing drudgery of an occupation that does nothing more than pay the bills. There is a thoughtful tension in Wilf Kasmires life that will ring true with working stiffs everywhere. He only truly feels whole and at peace when hes in the out-of-doors, and his decision to try his hand at guiding other hunters as a way to meet the bills is a natural enough turn. We are also treated to soul-probing conversations with his paramour, Adrienne, a feisty woman whose grounding presence in his life seems like just rewards after years of restless solitary angst.\\n  Nesbitt, award-winning author of dozens of novels, with POACHER'S MOON, offers a contemporary novel of the West, a study of one mans struggle with his passions, as well as a satisfying mystery. Nesbitts writing is lyrical yet tight, solid, and satisfying, and POACHER'S MOON is a novel meant to be chewed and savored, elk steak cooked to perfection.\",\n",

A SEAL Forever brings the West Coast Navy SEALs series out of the dreaded sophomore slump and roaring back into life with Declan and Mauras story!\\n\\nMaura Maxwell isn't exactly shy but she is somewhat reserved especially when it comes to her hotter than hell neighbor, Declan Smith.  Declan is a walking, talking wet dream but Maura has no interest in being a part of the hook-up parade that seems to pass through Declans door on a regular basis.  Maura has every intention of keeping her lust in check and private until the night she goes out for a quick swim and gets caught in a storm.  Declan not only rescues Maura but he also dumps her into a hot tub and kisses the crap out of her.  So much for remaining somewhat shy and reserved.\\n\\nDeclan Smith has spent his life either preparing for or performing for the SEALs.  There has never been anything other than the SEALs, staying totally fit and active, and women that have interested Declan.  Saving Maura from drowning not only brought her into his life but for the first time in his life has made him think about something more than just a hook-up.  Maura shares his love of the outdoors and activities, she is adventurous, and once the initial awkwardness was over, she is quit uninhibited, sexually speaking.  In short, Maura is the perfect woman for Declan and he has no plans to move on.  Maura is the something better!\\n\\nFor weeks Maura and Declan spend every available moment together and with the exception of a few bumps in the road, everything is golden.  Maura understands that when Declan leaves he is knowingly walking into danger and he may not return and these are things she is willing to accept about the man she is sure she is falling in love with.  Declans latest mission is more dangerous than ever before and when things go sideways, he doesnt return to Maura all in one piece as he expected.  In fact, it is more than a month before he returns and when he does, he isn't sure she is going to be willing to stay with a man who isn't whole.\\n\\nThe Bottom Line:  Woosh!!  Declan Smith is some kind of hot and with Maura by his side, he is just about the perfect man.  While I am generally a character-drive reader, the plot of this one and the way it unfolds is the real winner of this read.  Uncharacteristically, there is no slow build-up leading to the eventual relationship.  The relationship begins quickly and it is only later that Declan and Maura have to deal with real issues that will test their strength and relationship.  Their road to a HEA is not at all easy and I really liked the change in their relationship as they each deal with Declans injury and road to recovery.  This is a tightly written read with good characters and a plot that is both entertaining and different enough from the other two in the series to keep the series feeling fresh.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'This is the story of five southern ladies who work and live at the Ridgecrest Nursing Center in eastern North Carolina.  Margaret is the daughter of a Baptist Preacher and tobacco farmer.  She is as smart as a whip, tough and feels angry at her life in an nursing home.  She is in a wheelchair for the most part.  Someone has to feed her every bite she eats and someone has to change her clothes like a baby.  She can be very difficult but she says \"so what if I am?  I didn\\'t ask to be here, surrounded by linoleum, blinded by fluorescent lights or left alone in pure black darkness.\"\\n\\nBernice is a patient who suffers from dementia.  She has a stuffed monkey toy, who she talks to and carries around with her wherever she goes.  She has named him Mister Benny.  She feels protected and safe with Mister Benny.  If anything should happen to Mr. Benny, I hate to think what would happen to Bernice.\\n\\nLorraine is a \"Practical Nurse\" and not a \"real nurse\" as Margaret would say.  She is a church-going and God-Questioning nurse.  She is very kind to her patients and she knows very well the goings-on in a nursing home.  She has seen them come and go and talk to their stuffed animals. Lorraine always says regarding Bernice \"let her go, she\\'ll come back when she\\'s good and ready.\"  But as ma always says, \"I don\\'t care who you are, SICK and OLD are coming to see you whether you invite them or not.\"\\n\\nApril is Lorraine\\'s daughter.  She has earned a scholarship to study medicine at the University in Raleigh.  Lorraine is proud of her daughter and their relationship is one of respect and love.\\n\\nRhonda is a sassy hairdresser who comes to the nursing home to do the patients\\' hair.  She has problems of her own, but comes only on her day off, so she can earn a little extra money to one day buy her own hair salon. At first, she has a hard time with seeing patients with memory problems and talking to toys, but with time she learns how to adapt and even gets to like and care about them\\n\\nAs we age, our roles will change from caregiver to receiving aid. This story is about how we live and die, and love and forgive.\\n\\nTodd Johnson\\'s book is written with love, tenderness and respect for the elderly.  The Sweet By and By is perfectly written.  It is exactly how I found it to be.\\n\\nI say this, because I felt as though I was revisiting my dear mother Ruth\\'s final home, the Nursing Home, where she had spent the last two years of her life.  I remember meeting lovely ladies like Bernice and Margaret.  And I also met the \"Practical Nurse\"/Prepose, the very hard working, kind and dear, dear Lorraine, whose services we could not do without.\\n\\nI loved this book and everything about it.  I can HIGHLY recommend it.',\n",

Honestly, it is one of the slowest books I have ever read. The first part of the book is boring - basically a bunch of men talking and talking and talking and not coming to any real decision.  I believe that this is meant to be suspenseful, but it goes on far too long to sustain suspense.  At one point, I literally yelled at the book, \"Would someone just DO something?\"\\n\\nIt is the end of the book that makes it worth reading.  The brain numbing chapters are worth it once one realizes what the whole book is about - personal responsibility.  This book made me completely reevaluate my personal and political beliefs. A lot of what I believe as an adult was formed, not by this book, but by the thought it provoked.  I wish that the preceding text was a good as the end - then this might be the best book ever written. As it is, this would be a much better short story than a novel.\\n\\nI would recommend this book if you have the time to wade through a lot of nothing to get to the end.  Like many of the better things in life, it takes hard work but you reap fantastic rewards.  However, if you are looking for a good summer read or something to take on vacation, skip this one.

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'m having a lot of trouble figuring out my take on \"Ubik\".  I enjoyed the speculation it offers, where the futures of the afterlife, corporate culture, and advertising are imagined in a very believable (and simply explained) way.  I also enjoyed the suspense and mystery elements it offers.  Someone has sabotaged Runciter Associates, the world\\'s leading \"prudence organization\" (telepathic defenders against precognitive corporate raiders; don\\'t trust my explanation, just know that Dick\\'s is much more clear), and now they\\'re slowly dying off.  But how, and why?  It is an interesting setup and the answer comes slowly and assuredly (except for the ending, which felt like an unnecessary tweaking of the tension, and logically made little sense).  These disparate elements were handled well.\\nThe problem is that the elements don\\'t add up to a cohesive whole.  Or rather, a cohesive whole that transcends the genre.  Science fiction, to me, should speak about grand issues on a grand scale.  The issues here were focussed on a very small group of people, and did not really speak to a larger community.  I don\\'t feel threatened by a half-life menace, such as the one that stalks Joe Chip and his crew.  Although the idea of inertials, precogs, telepaths, etc. does hit close to home, the dystopian future Dick creates just didn\\'t scare me enough.  And besides, the characters he creates are quite slight, nothing more than two-dimensional devices around which paranoia swirls.\\nAnother problem is more a result of wasted opportunity, based on personal biases.  I truly enjoy works that explore the possibilities and perils of time travel (the second \"Back to the Future\" movie is my favourite of that series, and a fine example of the fun a warped space-time continuum can provide in a narrative context).  When the Runciter gang goes back in time (in a way), Dick only tangentially explores this phenomenon (e.g. Joe Chip discussing the outcome of WWII with a xenophobic pilot), and to me that\\'s not enough.  Like I said, it\\'s an opportunity wasted.\\nDick does his best work here within the epigraphs that begin each chapter.  Set up as advertisements for the mysterious title-product, each is a parody of omnipotent cure-all consumer products.  But Dick also throws in a menacing warning line that the unfocused consumer wouldn\\'t pick up on.  They provided the lion\\'s share of laughs in the novel.',\n",

Also, it makes a nice souvenir of where we have been, along with our own photos, but with descriptions and explanations. It is one of the first travel guides that I look for when we decide on a destination, and I look for the most recently published, unlike some other guides where I might be fine with one from the last year or so from a used book store or the library.

All precious women who were central to the Christmas history of Jesus' birth.\\n\\nMrs. Higgs can get more out of a few lines of scriptures than I can dream.  The insight that Mrs. Higgs gleans through use of multiple Bible translations and versions, study helps, original languages, and other research give a depth to the Luke 2 story that makes it vibrant.  You might say that her descriptions quicken the scriptures for us.  Contextual history and customs bring depth.\\n\\nCocoa, The Christmas Story, and insight from Sister Liz Curtis Higgs.  What more could you want?  Oh, maybe some slippers and a blanket.  Can you tell I enjoyed this book?\\n~smile~\",\n",

It amazes me how someone can call themselves a believer in Christ death on that cross for all who have sinned, but still GOSSIP and put fingers at someone in their own church. If you are under the blood how can you deny someone who received the same forgiveness you did. I have seen this happen and see people leave fetch because of it.

       "  'reviewText': 'The Inscribed Collection are four books, written by different authors on different topics. They are intended to be used as Bible studies although they would be enjoyable books to just read.\\n\\nIve never agreed to review  four books at the same time and I found the thought of it a bit overwhelming until the books arrived in the mail. These are quality books, printed on nice paper with that special, rough-edge page edge that gift books sometimes have. They are paperbacks but the kind of paperbacks that I would give as a nice gift.  That extra special feel to these books made it easier to dive into reviewing them.\\n\\nLeaving Ordinary by Donna Gaines\\n\\nI found this book disappointing because of the way the author constantly came back to her own personal experience as she learned to pray in a deeper way.  I felt that it was very experiential and might be disheartening to struggling believers who did not feel successful in their prayer life. In my opinion, a successful prayer life is one that continues in spite of flucuating feelings! Nevertheless, this book might be helpful as a study to many women.\\n\\nThe deepest longing of the human heart is to know and be known by God. God longs for an intimate relationship with us as well. But how do we develop that kind of relationship with a holy God? It is one thing to long for such a relationship, but quite another to experience intimacy with Him. In Leaving Ordinary, Donna Gaines shares from her personal experience how prayer can become the channel that links the believers heart to the heart of God.\\n\\nLiving So That by Wendy Blight\\n\\nLiving So That is a fresh approach to understanding Gods Word, focusing on many of the powerful so that verses in Scripture, including Jesus Came So That. . .; God Spoke So That. . .; Pray So That. . .; Trials Come So That etc. Through her approachable style, personal examples, and biblical teaching, Wendy equips readers to take what they study in the Word of God and live it out in order to impact the world around them.\\n\\nWendy does have a very fresh and appealing writing style. She is down-to-earth and very real. I found this book to be the most helpful of the series.\\n\\nAmazed and Confused by Heather Zempel\\n\\nMost people have prayed for something or someone in earnest, seeking Gods will, only to be left confused by Gods response. Sometimes we ask, Why would a good God allow bad things to happen to good people? In Amazed and Confused, Heather Zempel tackles this question head-on by exploring the book of Habakkuk.\\n\\nWhen the prophet Habakkuk prayed that God would bring change to the backsliding nation of Israel, this issue came to the forefront. Habakkuk begged God for revival and that He would turn the hearts of faithless people back to Him.\\n\\nGods answer to Habakkuk was, Take a look at the nations and watch what happens! You will be shocked and amazed (1:5, The Voice). The vision God gave Habakkuk was one of warfare and exile. How do you respond when God answers your prayers in a way that seems out of line with his character and promises?\\n\\nThis book tackled an important topic and did it well.\\n\\nDive Deeper by Jenifer Jernigan\\n\\nEquip yourself to fall deeply in love with Gods Word through this unique, interactive Bible study. Delving into the book of Ephesians, Dive Deeper is a tool for womenthose who might be satisfied and content with their Bible study and for those who find themselves fearful or numbto dive deeper into the living and active Word of God.\\n\\nThe author uses the acrostic DIVE to help the reader study the bible as they;  define, investigate, visualize and embrace. I found that approach to be helpful.\\n\\nThis collection of books is, indeed, a practical, helpful resource for women who want to grow in their knowledge and application of Gods word. Helpful study aides are included in each book as well.',\n",

He lists his sources so you can get started and do your own research. The government fails at almost everything they attempt, and they use your money to do it. Instead of admitting their failure, they usually add more departments, hire more people, become more bloated, and spend more money they don't have. So we end up spending more per student than anyone else and yet our country is way behind in academic achievement. There is a better way.

This one is less of a murder mystery, but still shines a light into the dark underbelly of Las Vegas. Kit Craig, investigative reporter and rockabilly chick, and her half-human, half-angel lover, Griff Shaw have been together now for a few months and the honeymoon phase has begun to crumble. More of Griff\\'s past comes in tantalizingly small pieces, but the focus here is largely on a new (and shockingly horrific) drug loose in Naked City. Many new characters appear here (including a rather jarring shift in perspective and verb tense) and there is little carryover from the previous novel. But the bulk of Pettersson\\'s unique urban fantasy setting is laid out in&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/The-Taken-Celestial-Blues-Book-One/dp/0062064649/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">The Taken: Celestial Blues: Book One</a>, so reading them in order is ideal.\\n\\nThis is not my favorite fantasy series - Kit, despite everyone else (humans, angels, demons) being desperately in love with her, fails to charm me and tends more towards the annoying (and self-pitying) than truly sympathetic or relatable. And Griff, though marginally more likable, has more flaws than strengths. But the side characters - like Sarge and Scratch - along with the setting and different premise, make this an entertaining read. And the cliffhanger at the end definitely has me looking forward to the next installment!',\n",

The story haunts me and every so often I feel compelled to read it yet again. Fitzgerald's writing is clear and spare yet delivers an emotional impact. The characters are not easily forgotten. Gatsby endures as a character because, in his depths, he is a poor boy in love with a rich girl whom he can't have. And that truth never changes no matter how rich and intriguing he appears. Underneath the veneer lies a vulnerability that only love, or illusion, can engender. Nick, as narrator, gives the readers a person we can rely on even though we know he too is flawed. Gatsby tells a story that never ages: the pursuit of wealth and status, unrequited longing and the consequences that result when one's single-mindedness threatens the status quo.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Seeing my parents dysfunctional relationship left me feeling impaired, but I moved past it. Then between the force accusing me of being a corrupt cop and Lisa walking out I put up barriers. It seemed logical that if I didn\\'t want to feel that way, all I had to do was not let people get close. You managed to break through those barriers. And now I love you. You know all my flaws. You get along with my crazy family. Both my real family and the friends. You make me laugh and And I love your cat, too. - Tyler Lopez\\n\\nTalk about he-geek finds she-geek in this amazing book that follows the story of three PI partners and best friends, in Christie Craig\\'s hotter than hell Texan romance series!\\n\\nTyler Lopez, the geeky one of the PI trio, knows all too well how foolish it is to trust your heart and not your mind. True love is rare, and with his screwed up genes, statistics show he\\'s not someone who can find - let alone keep - it. Betrayed by both the force and the woman he thought was his other half, he knows better than to let his heart be involved again. But, protecting Zoe Adams has him second-guessing his decision to keep his heart out of the bedroom. Because being around the redhead who claims is the dead Bradford heiress, makes him want to seek second chances at forever. Zoe always thought there was something off with her. She was so different than her parents, both in looks and other aspects, it was hard to fit in. Not to mention her nightmares - that always felt more like memories. Now she thinks she might have finally found out why - and who she really is. But her search of her true identity puts her in danger - and she\\'s been lied to a lot to easily trust the hot bookworm who took it upon himself to keep her safe.\\n\\nWhat\\'s not to love about a guy who\\'s got both the looks and the brains? Man, I love me some geeky ex-cop PI - in other words, helloooo there, Tyler~\\n\\nIf for some unknown reason I didn\\'t predict he was gonna be my favorite of the trio, then shame on me! I take full responsibility for being blindsided and not seeing it sooner. The guy was smart as s***, had manners, was funny and witty, knew how to respect a woman - or make her lose her clothes, and fast - and had a body to die for - and effing hell, when he opened his sweet mouth and spat out Spanish words, I swear I creamed my panties! Not to mention, I enjoyed reading his thoughts. Yes, he was making one mistake after the other when it came to Zoe, but damn, I can\\'t say I didn\\'t get the reason why. I\\'m a \"mind knows better than heart\" gal, too, after all. So where can I find me some of that? Preferably, with the same kind of whacko family and circle of friends, please!\\n\\nZoe was pretty cool, too. I loved how she defended him to his ex-colleagues, and how she could spar with him on equal mental ground. And she was no drama queen, so bonus points for the girl! Also, Strip Scrabble? Hell, I might just try that game myself one day. Certainly sounds better than strip poker or strip pool!\\n\\nThis book was so much better than the first one. Not only because of the couples that got together, but also because of the story development. Considering DeLuna, the main villain that the guys are trying to take down, there\\'s not much here to read, but Blame It on Texas serves as an excellent filler for the big finale that will come in the final book. It provides Tyler with his own leading lady, FINALLY answers the big \"what if\" question mark on Rick and Ellen\\'s relationship, and shows exactly WHY the guys have to end DeLuna\\'s \"career\" as soon as possible. The way everyone treats them, how they whisper behind their backs, how they pretend to be sorry for not supporting them earlier, or how they plain tell them they still consider them guilty and don\\'t trust them, shows the reason this chase, despite Tyler and Dallas settling down, has to go on till the very end. They need to get their lives back fully, need to clear their names and stand proudly straight without anyone else judging them, and to do that, DeLuna has to go down - well, you won\\'t find a protester in me, that\\'s for sure. It was also much more intense than Dallas\\'s story - there we knew Nikki was innocent, we just needed to find out who was the real murderer. But here, Zoe\\'s identity - and the reasons behind all this mess - do not get clear until the book is almost over. There seems to be no obvious clue to hold on to, and that takes the suspense to a whole new level.\\n\\nThe only thing that bugged me was the way everyone treated Rick. Even when he sounded and acted like a dick at the first book and the beginning of the second, the guy didn\\'t deserve to be badmouthed like that. Hell, they didn\\'t even believe he had a son, and they had Ellen thinking he said it to get in her pants! And this was all on the ladies, they did all the damage here! My heart broke every time LeAnn or Nikki opened their mouth and tainted his reputation without fully knowing what they were talking about. Alright, LeAnn had her reasons for not liking him. But Nikki? Heck no! Woman, you can\\'t just prance around in the first book, claiming to never be one to make false assumptions just because someone said so - and let\\'s not forget that it was because of such assumptions that you almost did time! - and then instantly jump to conclusions the minute you\\'re safe and secured as Dallas\\'s significant other. Nuh-huh, no way, it won\\'t do... Thank heavens for small favors - particularly ones concerning Ellen\\'s brains that managed to kick in before she lost that keeper of a hunk!\\n\\nCan\\'t wait to see DeLuna dead - or behind bars, though death would still not be enough for that piece of... work. And considering Austin is the real playboy of the group, I think I\\'m gonna enjoy it a little too much when he messes up with his own lady!\\n\\nIm in love with you, by the way. And its not because of Ricky. I mean, I love that you helped me, but its you. Everything about you. The way you approach life. I want you in my life. - Rick Clark',\n",

It should be obvious that the bombing of Sudan was an attempt to kill Al-Qaeda members, not civilians, while the 9-11 terrorists deliberately targeted civilians, in the hope of killing as many as possible.

       "  'reviewText': 'The characters in The Hope Store seem so real they\\'re like someone you know, and they make its magical realism natural and believable. But believability is almost beside the point; the truly remarkable thing about this novel is how it manages to dive deep into a profoundly serious and dispiriting subject with such a deft, light touch. Through the person of Jada Upshaw, we confront what most of us have experienced at one time or another: the loss - or lack - of hope. Through these marvelous characters, we confront this bleak deficit directly. Isn\\'t that what the best fiction does for us?  In the story\\'s darkest moments, we can still laugh at its turns of phrase and wonderful insights and observations, even as we consider one of life\\'s most basic question. As Albert Camus said in the Myth of Sisyphus, There is only one really serious philosophical question, and that is suicide. But how many of us want to go there? The Hope Store helps us, encourages us to go there, ask the question, and have a great time doing it.\\n\\nThe novel alternates between two points of view: Jada, who was born without a sense of hope, and Luke and Kazu, the feisty gay couple who are, respectively, the emotional center and brains behind The Hope Store. When we meet Jada, she plans to commit suicide in the next few months. Then she finds the Hope Store and has an \"installation\" but her lifetime of jaded cynicism battles with her new sense of hope and prevents her from truly believing in it. She decides it must be a fraud and should be exposed. Her struggles with hope and its side effects are the emotional journey of the novel.\\n\\nI could go on and on, but it would spoil a great story. If you\\'ve ever felt hope or hopelessness, you need to read this book.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"It takes a mean mind to make up further abuse against domestic violence victim Caroline, with the strain of a traumatised child, now has to endure. Firstly a chronic alcoholic abusive husband Peter, but now frightening, invasive high handed thug of a cousin, Nick.  With Peter's lies prejudicing Nick towards Caroline, his hatred for Caroline who is a gentle, caring and loving person, is hard to stomach.  In one horrible scene, Nick threatens Caroline that if she does not do as he bullying demands - 'I'll slap you senseless'. Even for the 1980's, domestic violence is no longer a hidden social issue and I was SHOCKED to see an author blithely writes this in.\\n\\nNick calls Caroline ' You're an amoral, promiscuous little bitch without either heart or conscience  but I'm going to teach you a few well-deserved lessons' and he proceeds to assault her. Nick justifies this by blaming Peter's alocholism on  Caroline 'You wrecked my cousin's life and NOBODY CAN BE ALLOWED TO THAT TO ANOTHER HUMAN BEING - bit convenience what HE is doing to a defenceless woman. Caroline goes into shock but all Nick does is pushes her roughly to go before anyone can see the shock she is in, and then makes his voice causal and light while he lies to the beloved mother-in-law, Helen that Caroline has a headache and gone to lie down.  This is a sickening scene.\\n\\nAt this point,  Caroline's despair over Nick battering her to the ground is so traumatic, that she could hardly get back up one more time to face life. I couldn't take any more, and jumped to the end.  To my utter disbelief, Nick tells Caroline that his horrible demeaning viciousness was to cover how much he LOVED her and how he was desperately trying not to fall in love. ON MY LIFE! the most pathetic HEA. I should have left this at the garage sale. It is an ugly, UGLY story\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"The Golem and the Jinni is one of the most unique books I've ever read.\\n\\nThe golem is created in the late 1800s to travel to New York to be a wife. While on the journey, the man dies, so the golem lands in New York harbor all alone, without any identification documents, and with the mind of a newborn. BTW, a golem is a creature made of dirt, but looks like a human and is tied to a master who she must obey no matter what. Our golem is rescued by a Jewish Rabbi, and takes the name Chava.\\n\\nA jinni is a creature created of fire. Our jinni, Ahmad, is released from a bottle in New York after a thousand years of captivity. The person who releases the jinni is a tin smith named Arbeely. Ahmad doesn't remember how he became captive, and we get occasional flash backs that eventually fill in the blanks. And, he's still not really free. He cannot transform into his jinni (think genie) form and has an iron bracelet that cannot be removed.\\n\\nThe Golem and the Jinni become unlikely friends. But there's a lot more to the story. The Golem and the Jinni is full of colorful characters, each playing their parts to eventually weave this marvelous story to its conclusion. It's a delicious ride.\\n\\nWhile certainly a fantasy novel, The Golem and the Jinni is also an excellent piece of historical fiction. The life in the Jewish settlement in New York in the early 1900s is depicted with detail and authenticity.\\n\\nMy only slight complaint is that the book is a bit long at 500 pages. Not that I got bored, but more like restless to find out what was going to happen. It kept my interest, even with the amount of detail that served to expand the number of pages. There are also a lot of characters, and some of their names change throughout history, so it takes some attention to keep track at times.\\n\\nIt's very difficult to explain the genre of The Golem and the Jinni.  It is such a mix and so wonderfully written that it defies classification, and it doesn't really matter that it does so. If you desire to be fully immersed in a historical setting and mesmerized by some unique fantasy, then I highly recommend The Golem and the Jinni.\",\n",

In this final installment of The Giver quartet, Claire is chosen to be a vessel at the age of 13. Her job in the community is to give birth to three children over the next three years. These children are called \"products\" and are placed with families that request families. Claire delivers her first child, blindfolded so she can\\'t see what is happening, and then her baby is taken away. Because having the child is so difficult for Claire, she is given a new job in the community at the fish hatchery. She will no longer be a vessel. Once at her new job, Claire becomes curious about the baby she gave birth to and finds ways to be with him in the child care facility. Her little boy is not doing well. He is not growing, he is fussy, and he does not meet community standards. One day he disappears, never to be found again. What has happened to her child, her son? Is he alive? Will she ever see him again? Claire is determined to do anything, even leave the only home she has ever known, to find answers to her questions. As she seeks the truth, she risks her life over and over again, but will she find an answer? Son answers many of the questions readers have asked since The Giver was published in 1993 and is a fulfilling conclusion to the quartet. An excellent read for grades 8 and up due to some content that may not be fully understood by younger students, including the artificial insemination of Claire and other vessels, the indication that babies that fail to thrive are destroyed by the community, a male character\\'s declaration that \"he was like a wife in unspeakable ways\" to his father, and the mutilation of characters by a sinister element. Very thought provoking for students of age and experience to fully grasp the content.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': '\"The science is settled\".\\n\\nNo, the science is quite often not settled. I live in Montana just above where Glacial Lake Missoula used to be in the last few ice ages. How many ice ages in the Pleistocene is only theorized - currently about 11 periods are recognized.. J Harlan Bretz in the 1920\\'s upset the geological community by proposing that the floods in the states of Washington, Montana, Idaho and Oregon were caused by the ice dam breaking apart near where the Clark Fork Dam is presently situated. Mr. Bretz was driven out of the scientific community as if he were a witch/warlock. He was proved right, but the argument of the scientists at that time was that the \"science was settled\". It was not.\\n\\nBretz demonstrates that the point of science is: to question, to explore, to refute by experiment, to propose and accept new theories, to reject older theories.\\n\\nSo tobacco smoke causes cancer and tobacco company employees wanted that information crushed. From there we leap to global warming is caused by man? Fine, but why has the IPCC reported no increase in warming in 18/19 years while CO2 has risen making every Climate Model from 10 to 20 years ago 100% dead wrong. The science is settled that the climate models were garbage. That is what is settled so far.\\n\\nThe top climatologist in the US back in the 1970\\'s was Reid Bryson at the University of Wisconsin where I took my (7) climatology courses. He said,\\n\\n\"You can go outside and spit and have as much influence on climate as a doubling of CO2\".\\n\\n\"If global warming is a 100 story building, the human influence is equivalent to the linoleum on the 1st floor.\\n\\nCan man alter the climate? Very possibly, but by no means is the science settled as to how much and why. Only Obama voters, Marxists and other deluded eco-Nazis believe this nonsense or people benefiting from the billions of dollars being thrown at \"scientists\" wishing to get huge grants. The East Anglia emails destroyed the current crop of global warming pushing \"scientists\".\\n\\n Good scientists don\\'t lie, cover up and try to delude people. Einstein did not but Jones and Mann? Well, well, well......',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Malcolm Gladwells book David and Goliath strikes a similar tone as his previous books, The Tipping Point, Blink, and Outliers.  It is a quick and fun read that is entertaining as well as enlightening.  As far as pop psychology goes, Gladwell is better than most.  He is not the harbinger of everything true as witness to his own critique of his former view on the usefulness of IQ and intelligence in Outliers: I think the general point about the benefits and intelligence leveling off at the high end remains.  But I now think the specific point made about law schools in Outliers was, in retrospect, nave.  I was not familiar with relative deprivation theory at the time.  I am now a good deal more skeptical of affirmative-action programs.  Yet he generally tends to shed light on ideas we take for granted and our assumptions that make us step back and think about things in different ways.\\n\\nI find that his writing brings forth many shades of grey to ideas that are often thought of as black or white or only thought of in one way.  I find his ability to do this both educational and worthwhile.  I enjoyed two of the ideas in the book the most.  First, the little fish in the big pond vs. the big fish in the little pond reference was very compelling.  Basically, the idea being that you may not want to get into Harvard and end up being one of the bottom students there  it might help on the resume, but ultimately the point he makes is if you go to another school where you are in the top of your class often your spirit, self confidence and (what he often proves) the careers outcomes supersede the former choice.  I think its understandable why that idea has merit.\\n\\nThe other idea that I particularly enjoyed, which was both interesting and pertinent to today, was the one on punishing crime.  I won't spoil it for you but lets just say its more nuanced than more punishment equals more compliance.  Ill let you read David and Goliath to find out the particulars.  Overall, the book is what youd expect if you've read any of his other works: fun, interesting and easy.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"***I received this book as a gift\\n\\nAll the Bright Places is one of the best things Ive ever read and if you follow my reviews, you know I read hundreds of books a year. Its beautiful, bittersweet, raw, the kind of read that sticks with you, that makes you open your eyes and see, really see. I love this book. And yes, I sobbed like a baby.\\n\\nAll the Bright Places deals with the horrible reality of suicide, depression, loss, and abuse. Its quirky, eclectic, fun, an odd ball of a book that quotes Virgina Woolf and finds magic in everyday places. Its heartbreaking, sweet, and silly. Theres an incredible uniqueness that wraps the story in a cocoon of light and love. I never wanted it to end.\\n\\nFinch is brilliant. A puzzle who refuses labels, and lives by whims. He takes on personas like Halloween costumes all the while trying to figure out who he wants to be without settling. Bad Boy Finch, British Finch, Nerdy Finch, every single one is hilarious, lovable, memorable. Finch is compelling and agonizing. He takes life and explores, never accepting, opening his eyes to the magic of everyday, the simple, the mysteries that lie buried in our surroundings. Thats what I felt when I read this-wonder.\\n\\nEach step of their wanderings is a mini discovery. A sigh like release of all the tension and negativity. What I got from All the Bright Places is how often we get lost in the monotonous, the mundane, that adventure can happen if you just look for it.\\n\\nRandom note: Someone finally gets my obsession with Anne Bronte, though I was slightly disappointed when Violet preferred the quiet desperation of Emily.\\n\\nThere are so many perfect, spontaneous, and passionate moments in this book. Snapshots of happiness.\\n\\nBut there is also darkness, the all consuming kind that suffocates and threatens. Ive never read about depression like that. Its hard to describe. Its an inevitable pull. Finchs fascination with suicide is coupled with fascinating facts that both enlighten and disturb. So many things about the rate of suicide, the methods, the support groups I never knew about and I think its amazing that so much is said in so few words.\\n\\nLiving again after crippling loss, its hard to get back up, to choose to live. Violet lost half of her soul with her sisters death, she lost everything she knew as real, and right, and true. Violet didn't know who she was anymore and let fear rule her. Experiencing Violets ways of dealing and watching her open up again was an emotional avalanche. Violets laughter because it has been so long in the making is a waking, almost like shes shaking off her sadness.\\n\\nTogether Violet and Finch are a lesson in love. In how freeing and pure and gut-wrenching love can be. I was left speechless and in tears several times. My heart swelled and faltered. What a fantastic, adrenaline rush.\\n\\nGET THIS BOOK. You won't regret it.\",\n",

I grew up with a serious mad love of gaming, so any time I find a book with that theme in it, Im always giddy as hell about it. Strong Signal takes everything I love about gaming and then takes it a step further by adding in a romance between two male gamers living two very different online and offline lives.\\n\\nI started this book with the intention of merely taking a quick peek before reading the books I was scheduled to read and review. Then I found myself intrigued with this book, with these characters, and before I knew it, I was in over my head and sinking fast.\\n\\nThis book and its characters are so damn compelling I couldn't put it down. Garrett and Kai are mesmerizing on the page. The more I read about them, the more I wanted to read. They both fascinated me, for a host of different reasons, from Garretts crush and over protectiveness of his loved ones to Kais insecurities and self-doubts, and yet, what captivated me most was how these two men found each other and how they became so much more than they originally envisioned.\\n\\nGarrett brought a much needed sense of safety to Kai and Kai brought out a lightness in Garrett that the man sorely needed. They were perfect together because they are flawed and unique and special and far more alike than either of them know.\\n\\nThis was such a fantastic and engaging read. I loved and cared about both of these characters right from the start. In fact, there is a scene near the end that made me cry because of how much I loved both Garrett and Kai. Their flaws became my flaws, their doubts became my doubts, and I just loved that the authors were able to take me there.\\n\\nDont miss this read, folks.

There are a couple of tangents which are carried a bit too far. The hoods at the Red Rooster can be shortened. An Al-Qaeda bombing that just was left to hang. Mr. Robinson could certainly have gotten into the espionage side of the story without an explosion that just didn't seem to fit the story. Bank's relationship with his girlfriend was left to hang unresolved in Bank's mind a bit at the end. That's fine & true to life. The rest of the ending I liked as well.

       "  'reviewText': \"Carlo D'Este's book on the Normandy invasion, Decision in Normandy, is first rate, and there is no competition, so far as I know, to his thorough history, Fatal Decision, Anzio and the Battle for Rome. So I eagerly looked forward to his new biography of General Eisenhower. Extremely disappointing.\\nOne might expect a book of 822 pages by a West Pointer to be good on military analysis.  But this book is not.  For example, D'Este points out that planning for the invasions of Sicily and Italy was hampered by the fact that the army, navy, and air forces had headquarters 600 miles apart from each other.  But was this Eisenhower's fault?  He had enough staff experience that he could have hardly failed to be aware of the problem, so why did he do nothing about it?  Or did he try and fail to budge his subordinants?  It would be nice to know how or why Eisenhower allowed this obvious problem to go unsolved.\\nI have never encountered a book with so many errors. D'Este was very poorly served by his editor, if in fact he had one. (He says he did. And a proof reader too.) Perhaps this book is proof that a spell-check on a word processor does not replace an editor. Some examples:\\n --'When not working, young Eisenhower could be found sipping a sundae at Case's Department Store'.' (Page 23) Since when do you sip a 'sundae'?\\n --'Indeed, were it not for his glowing reputation gained during the maneuvers, it is arguable that Eisenhower's name would not have appeared at all, had it not been for Mark Clark's persistence in extolling his friend.' (p. 82) This is about the worst sentence I have seen since I stopped teaching. Did Eisenhower's name appear because of his glowing reputation or because of Clark's persistence?\\n --'[T] he Japanese, whose seizure of Burma, Hong Kong, and Malaya culminated in the greatest humiliation in the history of the British army'surpassing even Dunkirk'when Singapore fell'.' (p. 294) It is true that the fall of Singapore was arguably the British army's greatest humiliation, but few, if any, think that Dunkirk was a humiliation at all, much less in the same league as Singapore. Churchill had to remind the elated British people that wars are not won by evacuations.\\n --'Nylon stockings'were unobtainable [in the U.K.]; instead young British lasses would draw a line up the back of their legs to simulate the seams.' (p. 316) Actually, 'young British lasses' (What were older women doing?) had never seen a nylon stocking. They were not introduced in the U.S. until October 1939, and not commonly available here until 1940, by which time Britain was at war. Few if any would have been exported. By the end of the year they were not available in the U.S. either, all nylon going to rearmament.\\n\\n --'It illegality [of a cash gift from the President of the Philippines] did not prevent MacArthur from accepting a payment of $500,000 in March 1942'.However questionable these payments, they were nevertheless legal under the terms by which MacArthur went to the Philippines in 1935.' (p. 735) In all my reading, I cannot recall another instance of an author contradicting himself in his very next sentence. Was the payment illegal or not?\\n --'The American Grant tank, with its puny 37-mm gun, was helpless in battle against the German Mark IV panzer; only the eventual arrival of the new Sherman tank would even the paying field somewhat.' (.370) I saved the best for last. This really takes the cake. The Grant had BOTH a 37-mm AND a 75-mm gun. This guy was an officer in the army. He should not make this kind of mistake. I thought that perhaps he meant to say 'Stuart' tank, which did only have a 37-mm gun. But it was just a scout tank, never intended to be a main battle tank. Eventually the Sherman did replace the Grant, while the Stuart was used to the end of the war. The whole sentence does not make any sense if you replace 'Grant' with 'Stuart.' (Incidentally, the British called Stuarts 'honeys,' because they were so reliable. It is kind of weird to read in British histories: 'And then 10 honeys formed a line of battle.')\\nFurther, if D'Este were at all familiar with the history of the desert war before the coming of the Americans, he would know that the Germans were very unpleasantly surprised when they encountered the first Grants in battle. Both the Brits and the Germans considered the Grant superior to anything the British produced, which admittedly is not saying much. While the Grant left much to be desired, it was not such a bad tank.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'The Captive Heart by Dale Cramer is the second book in The Daughters of Caleb Bender series about an Amish family in 1920 who moves his family to Paradise Valley, Mexico to escape religious persecution in Ohio. What they encounter is nothing they could of ever imagined. The novels are inspired by actual events from his family.\\n\\nMexico is in turmoil after the Revolution and bandits roam the country with no compassion. Taking anything they want. They steal, kill, and take women and children to sell into slavery. This is the second year for the Bender family in Mexico. Life is not getting any easier for them and their Amish community is growing as more families come to Mexico. They are even expecting a preacher to arrive soon. They are being ravaged by disease, death, and the unthinkable. No matter what happens, they are determined to live by their faith and remain true to their convictions.\\n\\nCaleb\\'s daughter Miriam, is struggling with her feelings for Domingo, a Nahua native who is a farm hand her father has hired and helped the family settle into Paradise Valley. He has also been like a son to Caleb and a true friend to the family.\\n\\nI loved the characters in this series. This story is fast paced, and is very interesting. Book two focus a lot on Caleb\\'s daughter Miriam and Domingo. Don\\'t worry you will still get a lot of the main characters from the first book.\\n\\nRachel, Aaron, Ada, and little Amos are attacked by bandits returning home from a doctor\\'s.  Rachel is kidnapped and Aaron left for dead. Ada wasn\\'t taken because the bandits considered her loco due to her mental disability. Ada runs off with 18 month Amos and has to find her way home. She surprises everyone with what she accomplishes.\\n\\nJake and Domingo go after El Pantera to rescue Rachel. Domingo knows the only chance that Rachel and Jake have to get home safely is for him to take a stand and fight. When they return home without him, Miriam and Domingo\\'s sister Kyra go searching for him to bring him home not knowing if he is alive or dead. They are fearing the worst.\\n\\nDomingo is a fascinating character who is honest, sincere, and a man of high principles. I found him intriguing. His search to understand this, \"God of the Amish\" intrigues him. He struggles with the \"fences\". You will just have to read the book to understand.\\n\\nYou can see the gospel is displayed in the lives of many characters. Each character is unique. Each one displaying their own strength of faith and weakness.\\n\\nI have to say that this has been an amazing series with an ending that you just can\\'t wait to read the third book in the series coming out in December 2013. So long to wait! Thanks Dale for a wonderful book.\\n\\nThis book has been provided to me my by Bethany House Publisher free of charge and in no way was I asked to give a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I\\'ve only been married for a year, and when I first got married an older female relative recommended this book to me. She told me it was a bit \"old fashioned\", but had some good advice for being a good wife and maintaining a happy marriage. I\\'ve heard all kinds of strange things about this book, from the extreme positive to the extreme negative, but I approached it with an open mind. But this book is SUCH a mixed bag. Although I learned some good ideas from it that I can practically apply in my marriage, some of the advice just seemed crazy and dangerous, and it makes it hard for me to recommend it to anyone except for people with really strong BS detectors.\\n\\nFirst the good: this book explains in a clear and understandable way that while men are expected to be the emotionally \"strong\" ones in a marriage, their egos can be fragile and its easy for us as women to hurt them with constant criticism and nagging. It recommends building up your husband\\'s ego and making him feel good about himself, letting him know he has your support through thick and thin. This seems like very positive advice, and has certainly helped me to be kinder and more supportive with my husband.\\n\\nNow the bad: Andelin seems to attribute ALL problems within a marriage, even infidelity and abuse by the husband, to the fault of the wife\\'s attitude and behavior. This seems ridiculous to me, since nobody is perfect and a marriage involves two people, both whom enter the marriage with their own problems and weaknesses. The most frightening example she gave was in the case of abuse. She implies if a man physically abuses his wife or kids, it\\'s probably the wife\\'s fault for nagging him too much, and he\\'ll soon stop if she\\'s nicer to him! Having volunteered in a domestic violence shelter, this is extremely dangerous and incorrect thinking, not to mention unfair to children growing up in abusive homes.\\n\\nSo yeah, there\\'s some good, but the bad parts were SO BAD and toxic to me that this book is staying on the shelf.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'One day in 1964, Vivian Schuyler receives a surprise package - a suitcase addressed to her great-aunt Violet. Vivian learns that Violet apparently murdered her husband (a much older scientist) and fled with her lover. The rest of the book alternates between Vivian\\'s perspective in 1964 and Violet\\'s perspective in 1914 as Vivian tries to discover Violet\\'s story.\\n\\nHonestly, I\\'m disappointed. There\\'s little I enjoy more than a historical fiction mystery slowly unraveled, and this just did not live up to my expectations. It was written well (although Vivian was pretty annoying at times...calling her parents \"Mums\" and \"Daddums\" got really old) and entertaining, but it felt like it was building to something and just never got there. The twist at the end was interesting, but not really a surprise.\\n\\nMy biggest problem was the number of plot holes that were never really addressed. Most significantly, HOW DID THAT SUITCASE GET TO VIVIAN? I feel like we got a nominal explanation, but not a complete one. Somehow it made it to Vivian\\'s mom (who is also named Vivian). The mom for some reason thought to forward to her daughter, even though it doesn\\'t actually belong to either of them (and they have the same first name...so why exactly does she think it needs to be forwarded?). AND THEN the mom gets mad when Vivian decides to figure out Violet\\'s story. If she didn\\'t want Vivian to explore this, then why forward the suitcase?\\n\\nNext, it appears that a different great-aunt actually knew the full story the entire time, and it turned out to be pretty easy to get to the bottom of it, once she decided to share one key detail.\\n\\nAnd last but certainly not least, there\\'s the story of Vivian and Dr. Paul. In general I\\'m not a big fan of insta-love, but especially in this case, there\\'s really very little redeeming about Dr Paul. This whole part of the story felt forced and unnecessary.\\n\\nI\\'m giving it 3 stars because I thought overall the writing was good, I was entertained for most of it, but the plot holes were just too much for me to get past. I might give the second book in the series a chance, since it will not involve the same characters, but it will not be high on my list.',\n",

If any member of polite society finds it, her reputation will be in ruins.\\n\\nWhen Niles Thornton, Baron Quinton, sees a book fall from a carriage, he retrieves it. When he reads its contents, he finds it difficult to believe Aurora Hyatt has been writing fantasies about him. What she needs is a husband, and Niles just happens to be in the market for a wife. His grandfather has decided it's time for him to settle down, take a wife, and provide him with grandchildren, or else he stands to lose everything.\\n\\nThe next time he sees her is in a crowded ballroom. Niles is already a little drunk; when he dances with her, he stops and kisses her. This is a a passionate, take-no-prisoners kiss. The guests are shocked to their toes about Niles' and Aurora's behavior. Needless to say, her reputation is now in ruins. The only way to even partially salvage her standing in society is for him to marry her, and move them to the quiet countryside. Niles isn't bothered by the notion, but Aurora certainly is.\\n\\nShe is mortified by her behavior. When Niles kissed her, she had forgotten all the people around; there had only been Niles, and her within his arms. Now, she has no choice but to marry him. Can a rake be reformed?\\n\\nI really enjoyed this regency romance. Neither main character was perfect, and I loved their flaws. It made them seem more realistic and believable. Their marriage has its ups and downs just like a normal one would. If you want to read something a little different from the norm in regency romance, don't pass this little jewel up!

Predictably, D\\'Antonio lauds so-called \"victim advocates\" and bigoted contingency lawyers as heroic champions of the oppressed. Yet D\\'Antonio routinely ascribes the coldest, most sinister, and mean-spirited motives to Church officials in their response to abuse episodes, thus portraying them in an almost cartoonish style.\\n\\nAfter decades of incessant and lurid media coverage about this issue, there is a dire need for an honest, balanced, and clear-thinking treatment of the Catholic Church abuse narrative.\\n\\nUnfortunately, D\\'Antonio\\'s Mortal Sins falls woefully short and widely misses the mark as such a treatment. The book qualifies as little more than another attack on the Catholic Church that adds nothing new to the public dialog about this very important issue.\\n\\nMuch more at TheMediaReport.com: [...]',\n",

She's at her grandfather's estate for the summer, and was looking forward to a last, happy summer holiday there.\\n\\nWhen she wakes up in the hospital, with little memory of the events that led to her injuries, she knows it's not going to be a normal summer.\\n\\nEuan and Ellen McEwan, Scots Traveller teens who found her and got her to the hospital, start out as her best chance of finding out what happened. Gradually, they become her friends. Meanwhile, events get stranger and stranger. Hugh Houseman, a scholar employed to help catalog the Murray Hoard and other valuables attached to the estate, disappears on the same day Julia is hurt. A collection of pearls that was part of the Murray Hoard, and which Julia remembers playing with as a young child, is missing and no one else seems to care about it.\\n\\nAnd then a body is found, dismembered, but believed to be Houseman's. When it's determined that Houseman was murdered, rather than dying accidentally or by suicide, the Travellers are the favorite suspects. The growing friendship between the McEwans and the Beaufort-Stuarts means Julia experiences first-hand some of the prejudice and discrimination against the Travellers.\\n\\nJulia is flirting with Frank Dunbar, another scholar employed on the estate, after giving him the impression she's a few weeks from her eighteenth, not her sixteenth, birthday. Her youngest brother, Jamie, is interested in Ellen McEwan. Their French grandmother's companion, Solange, was involved with Houseman. When older brother Sandy arrives, to take on the work Houseman was doing, he gets very friendly with Mary Kinneard, the librarian. There seem to be people prowling the estate at night, who just don't seem to be the hired night watchmen.\\n\\nJulia is coming of age while her family is going through a major transition, and while no awareness of it seems to have reached the Beaufort-Stuarts in Scotland yet, Europe is sliding toward war. She's not yet interested in flying--but she does know she doesn't want to stay home and live a quiet life, either as either a married woman or as a professional woman like Mary. I could not stop listening to this audiobook.\\n\\nA minor point, but I noticed it: Unlike most of the books I've read or listened to lately, this is told entirely from Julia's point of view. We only know what she knows, and what we can infer from what she knows. She's a smart teenager, but she's a teenager, who has led a relatively sheltered life--more sheltered even that her brother Jamie, because it's the 1930s, and they're from an aristocratic family. Anyone who has read Code Name Verity knows she'll go on to experiences that are anything but sheltered, but this is a look at her life before that. Wein wants us to get to know her characters, and look at them from different parts of their experience.\\n\\nRecommended.\\n\\nI bought this audiobook.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Interesting book - an easy read. It reports on travels of 30 years ago, so perhaps not necessarily representative of present-day Alaska. Not sure if it's simply the book's view, or real Alaskan pathos, but the experiences related in the book leave a somewhat sour taste. Alaskan life appears nefarious, pugnacious, rancorous, back-biting, dog-eat-dog with plenty of child and wife abuse and drunken rampages. I somehow had a more romantic expectation of people drawn together in solidarity by severe weather and isolation. Perhaps that was an incorrect expectation. The book dwells a little too much on personal situation, divorces, wives, girlfriends that are irrelevant to the book's theme, is skimpy on descriptions and impressions of natural surroundings (with the exception of the boat trip on a river which was beautifully rendered), but provides a lot of comment (albeit almost exclusively negative) on the people of Alaska. If Alaska is really like this, it's better that I travelled there from my armchair instead of actually going there.\",\n",

With her mind set on the mission, she prepared everything she needed. She even got financing so she doesnt have to worry about money. It all goes according to plan until she decides to investigate a curious boat and the adventure begins. Stolen gold, an old curse, the beautiful landscape of Alaska and Canada are the ingredients to a super enjoyable and entertaining story.\\n\\nKitty is an admirable character. She is fearless, loyal, honest but above all very human. She has a believable personality and her enthusiasm for life and its adventures is contagious. She keeps calm during some stressful moments and when the situation requires a focused and determined person, she is ready to play the part. We see her grow up and face great danger and is during those moments when we witness what a great character she is.\\n\\nThe rest of the characters are also likeable and each one has a defined personality. I like that the author made very clear the intentions and motivations of everyone.\\n\\nThe book includes a lot of action, there's adrenaline, tension and a lot of good laughs. If you never flew in a seaplane, don't you worry the descriptions and narration really take you into the cabin and you can feel the rush of flying above earth.\\n\\nI liked the little maps included by the author; they helped me to better situate the story. The fact that he used real places, geography and local history makes the book more solid and complete.\\n\\nThe writing is very good, with colorful and vivid descriptions. The dialogues sound real and natural. The rhythm is constant and during the key moment it goes a bit faster but you still can understand whats going on.\\n\\nI just have to say that I wouldn't label it as simple YA, it's true that the main character is just eighteen but for me the book can be enjoyed by people of all ages.\\n\\nOverall, its a really good book about a courageous young girl and her adventures.\\n\\n*** I received a complimentary copy in exchange of an honest review. ***\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'In his new book \"Ready for a Brand New Beat,\" Mark Kurlansky makes the argument that \"Dancing In the Street,\" the 1964 smash hit by Martha and the Vadellas, took on a life of its own as an anthem for the civil rights movement and became much more than the \"party song\" it was intended to be. He weaves together an interesting narrative that combines Motown, the \"Freedom Summer\" killings of civil rights workers in Mississippi, the outbreak of riots and violence in inner-city ghettos, and the ultimate betrayal of several of Motown\\'s greatest talents by label president Berry Gordy. He also discusses the exodus of whites from Detroit, the \"Motor City\" whose fortunes have drastically changed from the days of Martha and the Vadellas and other Motown greats. That he does so around a song that, at best, is an integral part of the Motown story but something of a footnote in the history of popular music is a bit of a flaw.\\n\\nGranted, as the book shows, \"Dancing\" wasn\\'t just about, well, dancing. In the African-American song tradition, coding your words to hide their meanings from white overseers was a fact of life on the plantations, as open expressions of discontent or rebellion might bring you the wrong kind of attention from the owners. So in some respects, \"Dancing\" was an obvious choice for the rioters or protestors who took to the streets to protest the modern-day conditions of servitude and oppression that characterized not just the South but much of the country during the period. But it seems like overreaching on Kurlansky\\'s part, especially once the song\\'s heyday in the mid-Sixties passes and he ends up cataloging the various covers over the ensuing decades (including the \"God bless \\'em, they\\'re trying\" mid-Eighties take by Mick Jagger and David Bowie, along with the hilariously over-the-top video). While the song certainly reflects the changing attitudes about race in the Civil Rights era, and its use as a rallying cry in riots is documented, I\\'m not sure that I believe Kurlansky\\'s assertion about the song\\'s overall importance, Many of the songs from that era could have served as the backbone for the book\\'s central argument about the way that music in general reflected the younger generations\\' growing away from the prejudices of the past.\\n\\nBut the book stands up as a documentation of Motown\\'s promise and betrayal; Berry Gordy revitalized the idea of black-owned businesses by trying to sell to as wide an audience as possible. He did so by restraining the performers from being \"too black\" and by choosing subject matter innocuous to white ears. In the same time period that Martin Luther King and Malcolm X seemed to battle for the soul of the civil rights movement, Motown\\'s most popular songs were about unrequited love. But the artists under contract felt pressure to address these issues, and over time they began to crack through the bubble Gordy constructed in Hitsville USA. Gordy paid his songwriters very little, and pushed the career of Diana Ross at the expense of others (including Martha Reeves). When he moved west, Detroit was no longer able to claim Motown as its own. In a sense, Gordy forgot the Motor City, and it set the city on a path which could only end in bankruptcy.\\n\\nThe book is mindful of these losses (including that of Marvin Gaye, one of the song\\'s cowriters whose life story ends most tragically, at the hands of his jealous father), but in the long run it\\'s a celebration of the song\\'s uplifting message. And for that I can excuse the almost odd preoccupation Kurlansky has with hyping the song as worthy of the book-length treatment. As someone who feels passionately about music myself, I can understand the desire to have songs mean more than they might on the surface. In the end, it\\'s not for me to say that Kurlansky was misguided in writing this book around \"Dancing In the Street,\" because the overall beauty of the book outweighs the flaws. So give the book a chance, and if you don\\'t think it was worth the effort, that\\'s fine. But I defy you to get the song out of your head when you do finish the book.',\n",

My 5 year old daughter was delighted to see that children who at first glance appear so different also share her love for soccer, animals, noodles, etc. Each child\\'s bio includes information about  their family, home, school, church, clothing, pets and favorite food. This  book has great photos, particularly of the children. Although there is much  writing on each page, it is not overwhelming for her, and we can stop after  one page, and easily pick it up again later. This is the first children\\'s  book that I\\'ve wanted to read by myself after she\\'s gone to bed!\\n****\\nFour years later, I\\'m adding this paragraph to this review.  I continue to use this book with my now 5 and 9 year old children.  It\\'s an fun way for them to learn a little more about families who live in countries that we learn about.  It\\'s easy to read something in this book that leads to a much wider discussion.

Her relationship with Sophia is close and warm, but Emily has never accepted Andi and it\\'s causing serious friction in her marriage.  As she wryly observes, the only times that she and Ethan fight, it\\'s about Emily, but lately the fights have been occurring more often and more bitterly.  Meanwhile Emily is going through an extremely rebellious phase.  One night Ethan gets a call to say that his daughter has been arrested, but that\\'s only the tip of the trouble that she has got herself into.\\n\\nThis is an extremely easy book to read.  I read most of it in one day.  It hums along, without any real twists or tension, but not entirely predictably either.  The main problem that I had with it was that I never cared about any of the characters.  Ethan, Andi and Emily are all pretty flawed and not terribly likeable.  Nor did I believe for one moment in any of Andi\\'s friends - they didn\\'t feel like real people.  But having said that, it\\'s still an enjoyable read and I still found myself caught up in it.  It\\'s the kind of book that you want to read on holiday, when you don\\'t want to have to think too much about what you\\'re reading, just have it go down nice and easy.

I have to say I really expected more out of the series being a huge diablo fan and because I really enjoyed knaak's warcraft based books.  This book makes me extremely hesitant to continue reading the diablo novels.  I hate to say that this trilogy ruined it for me but I just can't take them serious if they're on the same dramatic level as these.  Unfortunately I would advise against this series of novels.\",\n",

Two vastly different characters are both predator and prey each in their own right. The question is, who will win?\\n\\nArnie is s serial killer who was abused by his wife until one day he snaps and has been killing ever since. the only person he cares about is his young son. When he finds himself under investigation he will find himself forced into a position of drastic choices. Arnie is one twisted piece of work and we get some interesting psychological aspects. He thinks himself a strong killer who keeps outwitting the police but he isn't quite as smart as the thinks. This wealth has likely helped some and he is good, but just not all that. He is one sick man. What he does with his victims....Eww!\\n\\nAllison meets Arnie as a photographer but she is not all she seems and has an agenda of her own. But her past is about to collide with her all at the same time. Time is running short for the parties to make their moves. I liked her but also had a hard time trying to connect with her character. Maybe because it isn't easy to find out who she really is.\\n\\nI like how the movements of different characters continuously causes the other to rethink their next move. Like a game of chess. However after a while the story because predictable. Especially Allison. I wish she had remained an enigma. I think Jeff Gunhus tried but I just ended up pegging her down too early, killing some of the excitement potential.\\n\\nOverall, quite enjoyable. Not an amazing thriller yet but a good first for the author. I would be very willing to read another thriller by this author. 3 1/2 (going on 4) stars.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'At the time of my review, this book has a rating of 3.5 stars. I find this unfortunate as \"Mating Intelligence Unleashed\" is certainly one of the best books on the topic that I have read. This book provided a trove of solid, dare I say, life altering information. A couple of the  negative reviews of this book complained that it reads like an academic thesis. This book IS an academic / scientific book written by Evolutionary Psychologists. It follows a pretty standard format (think \"The Selfish Gene\" by Richard Dawkins or \"How the Mind Works\" by Steven Pinker). The Academic, scientifically sound nature of this book is fundamental to what makes it so good. For example, one of the portions of the book that another negative review referenced dealt with r/k selection theory. R/k selection theory is a concept from Ecology. When the book used this concept to describe human behavior is a Sociology / Evolutionary Psychology context, I had a \"mind blown\" experience. I\\'ve read a couple pickup (PUA) books but found them too sleazy and chauvinistic as well as relying far too much on opinion and personal experience. I\\'ve read a couple relationship books but found them to touchy-feely and, again, subjective. This book provides you with data. To be fair, I have a BA in Evolutionary Biology and regularly read scientific books in my free time (such as those listed above). Having said that, I think this book is very well written and should be accessible to anyone who has a passing understanding of Biology, Psychology, and Statistics.',\n",

The photos are nice, and add insight to the car and its construction, however because this is sent from Japan, by the time you add in freight costs, the book is expensive for what one gets for the money.  In comparison, the 312T Owners' Workshop Manual that was recently released is a better deal, as it really covers the details of this series of F1 cars, and has more, and better photos, more detail on construction, drivers, etc. and has more pages to boot.  I think if one resides in the U.S., the Owners' Workshop Manual is a better deal, as it is about 1/2 the price, the freight cost is lower, and gets to you quicker, and has more photos and technical details.  That being said, Model Factory Hiro's 312T is a good book, too, but not as good the Owner's Workshop Manual.\",\n",

In that series Jeaniene managed to create a magical world filled with good and evil, a strong kick but heroine who made me want to fight vampires but most importantly she created Bones and that right there sealed her fate in my eyes. Any woman who could create Bones is a woman who I will forever love. With Cat and Bones I also fell in love with the side characters so I was ecstatic when they each got books and I very impatiently wait for the rest to get their stories **cough**cough** Ian.\\n\\nSo when I saw and heard about her new series I was on pins and needles waiting, and then. (yes I added a period for emphasis) AND THEN, I saw The Beautiful Ashes available on NetGallery and hit request so fast I thought my mouse on my Mac would break. Do you ever want something so bad you are sure you won't get it, that was me I waited and came to accept that I would have to wait till the release of this book, and then(yes and then again) I got the email telling me I was one of the lucky few. This book has been burning a whole in my kindle and with no more will power I broke into my kindle hit The Beautiful Ashes book and DUG IN.\\n\\nIvy isn't sure life can get any worse her sister is missing and her parents are dead so she is doing everything in her powers to find the only person she loves who is left. While looking she see's something she isn't supposed to see, something that the pills and the therapists have told her for years she doesn't see. But with her sister in the vision of another place just like the one she is at but different Ivy can't ignore them anymore. So when she goes back to her hotel to find a man in her room the shock has well worn off. And when the man saves her and takes her with him with the promise that he can help her save her sister. Ivy wonders if she will finally be getting somewhere.\\n\\nWhen Adrian brings her to Zach and some of the truth is revealed of who she is and who Zach and Adrian are she is shocked but if saving her sister is part of the deal Ivy is all in, even if the world and every truth she has ever known is turned upside down. With the help of Adrian who is hot (for her it seems) one minutes and colder than ice the next Ivy sets out to find the weapon that will save good and rid the world of evil. Ivy is the key, she is the last in a line that can save the world, soon she is being brought to the demon world in search of not only her sister but the key to saving the world.\\n\\nEven though the pull between Adrian and Ivy seems to be getting stronger and Adrian himself has made it clear that he will leave the second they have fulfilled their mission, Ivy can't help but think the outcome will be different. As Ivy and Adrian's bond grows stronger they are brought closer and closer to their mission till all at once the end is here and Ivy will have to decide if she is strong enough to be the one to save the world and her sister, and maybe even more importably strong enough to save Adrian the man she loves.\\n\\nThis book was chocked full from begging to end. Jeaniene has done it again she has managed to create a new world so filled that you can't help but believe it's real. This is world building at its best. Though this book isn't as heavy on the romance it was more than enough to make me happy and I easily fell in love with Adrian and his temperamental self (and since Cat and Bones first book was similar, I'm hoping there is even more in book 2). I was about out of my seat reading the end of this book I couldn't turn the pages fast enough and I couldn't see what happened fast enough. I can't wait to see what happens next in this series, this new series though different will be on my must read list just like all of Jeaniene Frosts books, book two can't come fast enough!\\n\\nARC kindly provided by NetGallery and Harlequin HQN for my review\",\n",

It gave me the feeling of a grander suspense, like were all going about our contemporary lives, unaware, right before the whole of civilization comes crashing down. Of course I could be wrong. The writer definitely creates puzzles for the savvy reader to solve. Dont worry, its a really enjoyable read with great surprises and excitement, even if you don't feel like following the threads of deeper meaning that sprout off so many sentences and details like roots. The way that the characters earnestly struggle to justify their choices, and shape their futures, and avoid their memories, I was truly charmed by the end. In our modern lives that can feel so on the surface or distracted or jaded, I felt a deeper sense of connection when reading Heal. I can confidently say Jude Baas is a tremendously skilled writer.

This is a good story about forgiveness and love for the very hardest to love. Sometimes the descriptions and narrative are too lengthy. I have an extensive library, and I don't know how this guy has not been discovered yet. Wrapped in Rain is a great story of family. The dynamics between son and father and house keeper who steps in as Mom is so real. I loved this book. Powerful and filled with emotional scenes that did their job and had me reaching for the tissue box more than once.  Characters are relatable and a tragic past, trying to make it through to tomorrow - just my kind of read! I'm not a huge fan of walloping the reader with a faith message, and I have to admit a couple of scenes toward the end of the story seemed a bit heavy-handed for me, (I am a Christian so I didn't care) and I wondered what a person who did not share the author's faith would think. I loved Miss Ella, Mutt, the Judge, would have liked a little more development of Katie. I couldn't quite figure her out. Even felt a little sorry for Tucker's deadbeat dad at the end.

Bishop is the biggest baddie and I'm seriously concerned about him taking over the town. It was fascinating to watch the factions forming. Humans who thought they could get rid of the vampires turn on Amelie and become pawns of Bishop. Oliver allying with Amelie to help battle Bishop. And Myrnin remaining the wild card in everything. Claire and her friends once again try to save the day and stay alive. The return of Shane's dad spells epic trouble in the next book. The cliffhanger ending makes it impossible not to pick up the next book as soon as I finish this review!\\n\\nCarpe Corpus\\n\\nThis book kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I kept rushing through my work to get back to it. It was a rollercoaster of emotions traveling at hyper speed. The tension never let up for more than a minute. Every time I started to think people were in the clear, nope, something worse happened! The face-off with Bishop was epic. Totally worth sticking around for this book. Claire and Shane's relationship went to another level of love and it sweet and beautiful in the maelstrom of events around them. There were losses that brought tears to my eyes and twists in the plot that left me gasping. I don't know how Ms. Caine threads all these subplots together, but she does it so well! I'm off to start the next book!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Witty, sharp writing and a great story. Arthur Less has come to that point- soon to be 50, latest book turned down by his publisher and his younger boyfriend is planning to marry another man- where he must move past inertia and out run angst. Arthur goes through his ignored invitations and begins accepting-yes to an interview with an author in New York, yes to a symposium in Mexico, yes to a guest professorship in Berlin, yes to a gig as a food critic in Kyoto., yes to India, yes to Morocco, Less starts out on his Odyssey and the story is interspersed by memories of his younger self as events spur memories and acquaintances spark reflections. I grew so fond of Arthur, and laughed out loud at some of his predicaments and his situations. I got this book as a library loan but I am buying it because I will want to read it again- and again I suspect. Greer is an author I will follow, he has a way with humor and pathos.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'David Winston and Merrily Kuhn have written an excellent clinical manual on the use of herbs and supplements, in a convenient pocket format- no mean feat for a 540 page book!  The book is a significant upgrade from the first edition with 16 new monographs and extensive updating of references and new research.  115 herbs and 14 nutritional supplements are presented in monographs which are both more detailed and more clinically informed than information found on web programs commonly available to doctors, herbalists or other medical personnel.  Unlike most such books, the authors have many decades of experience using the herbs in clinical practice and thorough research backgrounds.\\n\\nThe monographs cover accurate identification, parts used, constituents and their actions, other known actions, nutritional ingredients, traditional uses, current uses and research, available forms, dosages and administration guidelines, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, side effects, contraindications, long term safety, use in pregnancy or lactation,  drug/herb interactions and rationale (if known), special notes or uses and an extensive bibliography for each herb.\\n\\nThere are also a number of useful tables including herbs contraindicated in pregnancy, differentiated from those which require professional guidance; stimulant laxatives contraindicated in pregnancy (although the chart is also useful for those who wish to avoid laxative dependence), and herbs contraindicated during lactation.  The table on conditions and possible therapies can be a useful reminder, although it cannot substitute for professional training in the use of herbal medicines.\\n\\nOne should not look to this book as a guide to the use of vitamin supplements- only 14 common supplements are listed.  That is not the aim of this book.  However despite its small size and lack of photographs, it is perhaps the best herbal materia medica currently available on western herbs.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'As a Christian I found the combination of psychology and biblical stories to be very enlightening.  David Stoop really has a command of the \"talk yourself to sanity\" idea. This book seems to have been written in the 80s so some of the information is a little outdated. However his take on \"The Secret\" before it was popular is interesting. Apparently people were trying to manifest material things way back then with disappointing results.\\n\\nThe only thing I think I disagreed with the author about is anger. I\\'m much happier now that I get angry far less often. I don\\'t think anger is a healthy emotion if you are getting angry all the time. Some self-talk may help you in this case. In fact this book claims that anger and fear are responsible for major illnesses.\\n\\nI feel this book will appeal mostly to a Christian audience, however it will also appeal to those patient enough to deal with the Kindle book which has a outdated font. At least it looks like the book was scanned into a computer after being typed with a faulty typewriter. All the \"e\\'s\" are especially annoying. Yes I had to talk my way through this book to keep reading. I\\'d suggest the paperback instead of the Kindle version.\\n\\nHowever, despite this the book has some value even 32 years later. It has a lot of wisdom and focuses on how attitude makes or breaks us. This book will also help those who are prone to worry or who are very stressed out by their thoughts.\\n\\n~The Rebecca Review',\n",

Simply put, it explains basic tenets of Libertarianism within the context of an engaging narrative that makes it very easy to understand. The author skillfully weaves complex thoughts and ideas into the flow of an interesting story filled with a host of colorful characters, each representative of people in todays times.  I find politics in our country so ironic: we are a nation that prides itself on diversity, melting pot, respecting different cultures, etc., yet we are supposed to be pigeon holed into two political parties? The time has come for at least one of if not more viewpoints to be taken seriously. Free Dakota presents the Libertarian one in a clear manner that is neither boring nor preachy.

The party was founded by Abolitionists who elected Abraham Lincoln in the divisive presidential contest of 1860. Lincoln s vision of his party changed as the Gilded Age appeared. During that time the Republicans allied themselves with big  business electing presidents such as US Grant., Rutherford B. Hayes and Benjamin Harrison.. Then came the wonder that was Theodore Roosevelt! Teddy was a reformer who sought to tax corporations, clean up the environment and reduce working hours for women and children. His leadership led him to break from the Republicans and form the Progressive party on which he ran for president in 1912 to loose to Woodrow Wilson the Democratic candidate. Following the end of World War I the country turned to the Republicans Harding,Coolidge and Hoover. The Depression struck and no Republican was elected until the great president Dwight Eisenhower in 1952. Reagan was a movement conservative who was a follower of Barry Goldwater. The GOP has moved to the right favoring white voters, evangelicals and opposing big government\\n  Professor Heather Cox Richardson has done a good job of telling the story of the Republican Party. She is a professor of history at Boston University. This is a controversial book since it is obvious the author is a liberal. I found her book to be enlightening, well informed and beneficial.',\n",

If you are experienced in C programming and want to start learning about embedded systems and ARM, I don't think this is a good book. It assumes you know absolutely nothing about C. It explains 'in detail' concepts such as a=a+1 is equivalent to a++. For every code example or project it uses the mbed library, which basically does everything for you. There is only one chapter at the end of the book where the author doesn't use the mded library, and flashes an LED by accessing the controller GPIOs.  That was to me the only chapter I learned something from. But I was hoping to learn something else than flashing an LED. The projects in the book are really easy to implement and they work great. But from my point of view you learn nothing from them, because everything is done under the hood in the mbed library.\\nIf you want to work on fun projects without caring about the theory and details behind, this is a good book. But if you want to learn ARM or embedded programming, you may want to try with other books such as Valvano's books on ARM Cortex microcontrollers (those books do not use the mbed libraries and are much more advanced).\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"THE 30th CHITTY: OUR PILLAR OF THE COMMON LAW\\n\\nAn appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers\\n\\nWe have been using Chitty for 40 out of its 180 years and it remains the most important single work in the Sweet & Maxwell Common Law Library, and the top practitioners work of them all!\\n\\nRightly described as guidance of the highest calibre, Professor Beale and his 18 team members have produced the best foundation on which to base a case in contract, with an understanding second to none. We have confidence in this work as it gives the depth of insight we need when we negotiate or dispute a contract in any forum.\\n\\nThe new edition remains in two volumes with over 4,000 pages. Do read Beales most helpful preface which sets out, at a glance, the main changes since 2004. In those four years since edition 29, the digital world has now come to Chittys 30th, and readers can view it fully online at Westlaw, thus opening up welcome new horizons for many practitioners brought up with IT.\\n\\nEditing Chitty is clearly a massive undertaking, being a work of unrivalled expertise from the alpha and omega of contract law (plus all the arguments), encompassing each and every part of the substantive law brilliantly. Generally, we tend to use volume one mainly for commercial situations although the specialist areas in volume two give that in-depth appeal which is the hallmark of the entire work.\\n\\nWhenever you draft a contract, Chitty gives that expert interpretation of the legal position with its tested authority which means you can rely on every eventuality being taken account off. When you get to negotiations with the other side, you can have the confidence that this book gives, making sure you miss nothing vital when backing up your arguments.\\n\\nChitty really is the pillar of our common law with its two supports: one, the easy reference to relevant legislation, and the other, the expert interpretation of case law with all those expert contract commentaries on latest developments. Throughout, there are the in-depth chapter contents headings as part of the common law library format, and indexes in both volumes to give quick access to the right sections and paragraph numbers.\\n\\nReaders new to the work will probably find it a little heavy initially, and there are a lot of footnotes, but don't despair!\\n\\nHowever, once the user becomes more familiar with the volumes, the insight of experience together with that vigour of youth emerge to present a statement of fundamental law which has always been indispensable, and is now always available anywhere- welcome to our digital century with all your detail and deliberation!\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Morrison's Jazz is inspired by the music genre jazz. Like the music genre, the book brings different styles or should I say characters' viewpoints together and makes a solid and flowing piece. The core plot of Jazz is about a couple, Violet and Joe, whose marriage is on the brink of collapse.  Violet and Joe each bring issues to their marriage that make it unstable and unhealthy. However, as Violet and Joe contemplate their present situation, Morrison shows that the issues between Joe and Violet do not start with them but with their ancestors and heritage. It is a creative work that shows that human history, in particular African American history, is circular and ongoing. There are many examples in Violet's and Joe's family tree that explains their personality.\\n\\nI believe that Tony Morrison was trying to show that African Americans like other racial and ethnic groups are affected by their past.  However, unlike some ethnic groups, their family tree and history is not straight forward and routine but complex and little bit unstable. In the end, Morrison is trying to show, that though the history is unstable, everyone can learn about themselves by understanding the past. In Jazz, finding the truth about the near and far past become a healing mechanism for the characters of the story.\\n\\nI did agree with some readers about the difficulty of following the plot, but I don't think it is a flaw as long as the plot stays true to its message. Morrison kept her focus in this book.  She wanted to emphasis the connection of then and now and I felt she did it beautifully. I found her style of writing unique and refreshing, yet not to difficult that the book completely losses the main plot.\\n\\nIf you are used to reading novels that tell the beginning, middle and end in its summary, then this book is not for you. If you are interesting in following a good story line with a few twist, then I recommend this book to you.\",\n",

At the time it happened, the case held the entire nation\\'s attention for a few weeks.  (It was that year\\'s \"Crime of the Century.\")  The way Schechter wrote it, The Mad Sculptor is not a suspenseful \"whodunnit\" (although there is some suspense during the \"manhunt\" portion of the book).  Instead, it\\'s a tale of mental illness leading to murderous obsession, also providing a view of the tabloid media of the era, what police crime-solving methods were like in those days, and how little mental health was understood back then.  One of the main attractions of the book is getting to know the unique characters who populate its pages: the drunken father/husband of the victims, the beautiful model who was the killer\\'s main target, the famous & colorful defense lawyer, etc.  The story is also well told and apparently was well researched by the author.',\n",

Johnson had to immediately take the reins of the Presidency. Within a few months, after the mourning, the election was on.\\n\\nIf you read this, then you have likely already read The Making of the President 1960. White follows a similar format and his novel-like approach to describing the election. He follows the road to the Republican nomination and the primary campaigns of Barry Goldwater, Nelson Rockefeller, among others, before ending in the convention itself.\\n\\nHe describes the biggest issue of the day: civil rights. Events, such as riots and protests, are key to understanding the issues faced during the times.\\n\\nThen it was on to the general campaign between ultra-conservative Senator Barry Goldwater and Lyndon Johnson, one of the most liberal Presidents in American history. When election night passed, Johnson had won in a landslide winning forty-four states. Goldwater winning less than 40% of the popular vote.\\n\\nOn the good side White continues his innovative story-telling that brings the events of the day alive. Those familiar with the style of the first book in the series will find the same format in this one.\\n\\nOn the down side is a problem that is not even White's fault. Simply the 1964 election was hardly the most interesting in American history. While 1960 pitted the big names of Kennedy and Nixon against each other, in 1964 we have Goldwater whose name has generally fallen into obscurity except by those versed in political history. I found myself struggling to get through parts of the book, especially during the primary campaign.\\n\\nStill, it was mostly enjoyable. Although I felt 1964 was a step down from 1960, those interested in political history will probably enjoy it.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Okay so this book is hot. Like make you blush all over and fan yourself hot. But while that is a lot of fun, I need character depth and world building to keep me vested. And for the first 50% I was pretty uncommitted to the characters. I can't say this was the most eloquently written book I've read. But I did enjoy the creativity and the author provided a great deal of detail for world building. And I was really appalled at Ryder's behavior and the Fae's sexual practices in general.  Once I let that go the more committed I became. This is written as fiction and about fictional realms. Therefore I needed to get my a** out of reality and allow the fantasy to take over. That behavior is Fae normalcy. I got it. My biggest holdup was the whiplash the heroine caused. Her hot and cold, I hate you but I need you routine wore my eyes and head out. I understand self preservation and refusing to be owned, but, she wasn't living or dealing with human customs. I know I liked the world enough to continue reading and the pace was exciting and fast.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Kipling\\'s critics have long been regarded him as the \"bard of imperialism,\" but the title is telling of his work. In many of his stories he has promoted the virtues of the Queen\\'s empire and created marvelous tales about the adventures of explorers.  However, in The Man Who Would be King, Kipling complicates his popular themes by implying a distinction between the cavalier, enterprising upstarts of early empire and the more entrenched, administrative empire that he personally knew.\\n\\nThe Man Who Would be King intersects the lives of the narrator (a stand-in for Kipling himself), the responsible and respectable journalist, with Daniel Dravot and Peachey Carnehan, two adventurous misfits. Through the narrator, Kipling expresses nostalgia toward the earlier days of the empire, represented by Dravot and Carnehan. However, this fondness is tempered by the view that the attitude of the early entrepreneur-imperialists was nave to the realities and responsibilities of administering an empire, embodied in the narrator. This distinction is seen in the cautionary attitude that Kipling takes toward Dravot and Carnehan during their first encounters, the rapt attention that the narrator pays to Carnehan\\'s recounting of his adventure, and the ultimately tragic ends which both Dravot and Carnehan meet.\\n\\nDravot and Carnehan are caricatures, to be sure, of the enterprising spirit that so many British in India came armed with, each in search of their personal fortune and adventure. In his first meeting with the narrator, Carnehan declares, \"If India was filled with men like you and me, not knowing more than the crows where they\\'d get their next day\\'s rations, it isn\\'t seventy millions of revenue the land would be paying-it\\'s seven hundred millions.\" Of course, this is a persuasive technique that Carnehan uses to build camaraderie with the narrator, and it appears to be somewhat successful. The narrator seems enchanted with the attitude of his companion, prefacing their encounter with \"he was a wanderer and a vagabond like myself.\"  Of course, we know that the narrator is a newspaperman who spends long nights laying type for the morning paper, not vagabonding around, however he inserts this to demonstrate a connection with this wanderer.\\n\\nFollowing this encounter, the narrator is approached at his office by the two who hope to gain basic information to allow them to go \"away to be Kings.\" However, the narrator is instantly concerned that they are hatching a foolish plan and exclaims, \"You\\'ll be cut to pieces before you\\'re fifty miles across the border,\" and \"You two are fools...You\\'ll be turned back at the Frontier or cut up the minute you set foot in Afghanistan.\" He is unable to dissuade them from their journey and the next day sees them off at the local bazaar, still expressing concern: \"`Have you got everything you want,\\' I asked, overcome with astonishment.\" He hears little else of the duo for the next three years, and assumes them to be lost causes in their journey.\\n\\nUnexpectedly, though, the unrecognizably disfigured Carnehan interrupts and recounts his story for the rapt narrator at his desk one night three years later.  Perhaps partly because of his disbelief and partly due to his fascination with adventure, the narrator listens, attentive to the final detail, to the tragic tale of Peachey and Dravot. At the end, Carnehan produced from his bag \"the dried, withered head of Daniel Dravot!\" and then \"shambled out of the office.\" The narrator finds the tattered figure on the street, and shows his loyalty to his fallen brother by driving \"him to the nearest missionary for eventual transfer to the Asylum.\"\\n\\nThe ending of the story is particularly filled with allusions to Kipling\\'s feelings on the matter of the British Empire.  The adventurous Dravot and Carnehan represented an anachronistic attitude of the Empire that, fortunately or unfortunately, did not belong in the Empire of Kipling\\'s day. They attempted their adventure, and though they were successful for a short time, they ultimately failed in their endeavors. The narrator, as the modernized colonizer, knew that tragedy was their fate and saw it as his duty to warn his brothers, and in the end care for them.  This interpretation does allow for the sympathy that the narrator demonstrates when meeting with Carnehan on the train and when absorbing the details of their journey.\\n\\nA slightly different analysis of Kipling\\'s attitude suggests that Kipling has become disillusioned with the Empire as a whole.  This puts Dravot and Carnehan as the embodiment of all colonizers, not simply earlier ones, and the narrator as a wizened British subject who has learned from the mistakes of his past. He cautions and cares for his misguided brethren, and knows that they will meet tragic fates, but he is still captured by the nostalgia of past days of enterprise and adventure. He longs for those days, but has the benefit of hindsight to know the sad outcome of adventurous hubris. In this interpretation, the crowned head of Dravot represents the caution to the current crown of the fate they may face if they do not reverse their imperial ambitions.\\n\\nIn either analysis, Kipling\\'s adventure tale appears to be a sober warning to any \"would-be\" kings, be they British or otherwise. Ironically, this tale may be rather timely to Americans in light of the current military involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq. Kipling would likely, though sadly, be vindicated in the fact that history does repeat itself.',\n",

This book is a story of courage, of determination, and of overcoming adversity.  I have one son who rowed in college, and I never appreciated how much skill and energy went into the sport.  It is beautifully written and best of all, it is true!  The history of rowing will astound you, not only the young crew team and their coaches, but the history of the man who built all these astoundingly beautiful shells.  Along with the story of the crew, one learns so much about Washington State history, e.g., the building of the Grand Coulee, as well as so much history of Hitler's Germany and the Olympics.  I gave this book to my 16 year-old grandson for Christmas and I'm praying that he'll read it; he spends most of his time playing video games - oh, if only he reads this book and from it develops a love of reading.  It should be required reading for all high school students.  Loved it!\",\n",

Like many, she couldn't understand how God could love her. Tormented by her inner demons, she finds herself tossing back a bottle of Xanax to end it all. Her book shares how she learned to let the past go and to embrace the redemption that God has for us. For so many Christians, it is easy to speak about hope and forgiveness yet inwardly they struggle with self-acceptance. This book will make an impression on many others facing the same and I am thankful Kasey had the courage to relate her struggle. I can completely relate to this book as I went through similar struggles in my twenties and you can not know the true peace of God until you make peace with yourself. This book should be on every Christain counselors bookshelf. I highly recommend. It was my deep pleasure to review this book for Tyndale House in exchange for my honest review.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"I've always been a fantasy fan...I enjoy reading Jordan, Tolkein, etc.  All of these books created a world from basic ideas.  Herbert does much of the same...Dune is a desert land that requires a hard existence.  The Fremen, people that naturally habit this land, are a troubled people that exist for nothing more than to create life from nothing.  Paul, the main character, is adopted by these people, and becomes their spiritual leader.  It is a good story that is very origonal (I haven't read any other story that compares).  I find that as you read fantasy books, many of the ideas presented by todays top writers are borrowed from one another (just written in a different way, with different characters).  I don't know about you, but this gets old after a while.\\nAnyways, I started reading dune 5 years after I bought the book.  I had tried reading the story many times over those five years, but I'd get lost or disinterested in the story because of all the made up language, philosophical mumbo jumbo, and from the fact that basically, the book starts out slow.  After getting through the first 50 to 100 pages, the story becomes very involved and very real.  It was written very well.  I understand why this is the highest selling sci-fi of all time.\\nFor those that enjoy fantasy, this book is clasified as a sci-fi, but really, it is in between.  It doesn't have the space-flying-fighting juck that i normally would associate with a sci-fi novel.  It's definitally worth the money and the time. Buy this book.  You'll enjoy it.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'World-class mountain climber and guide gets a posthumous tribute from a mournful, devoted friend and fellow mountaineer.\\n\\nBirkby opens atop the 18,000-foot Himalayan peak Kala Patar. It\\'s 1996, and Scott Fischer (1955 - 96) is showing him the skyline of Mount Everest, where Fischer will shortly lose his life. That climb was a far cry from the pair\\'s initial adventure back in 1982, when Fischer convinced a then-inexperienced Birkby to scale Mount Olympus.\\n\\nThe author details Fischer\\'s childhood, when a love of camping and a penchant for thrill-seeking blossomed into challenging hikes as a teenager with the National Outdoor Leadership School. He would later join NOLS as an instructor, counting among his students Sebastian Junger (The Perfect Storm, 1997, etc.).\\n\\nBirkby tenderly recalls Fischer\\'s clumsiness in his early 20s, when he miraculously survived more than 12 deadly plummets and was nicknamed \"the Fallingest Man in Climbing.\" After gaining increased experience and acumen, he left NOLS and formed Mountain Madness, a company offering guided climbs whose motto was \"Make it happen.\"\\n\\nDeftly detailing Fischer\\'s life in conversational prose, Birkby shares stories about encountering bears and traversing frozen terrain in the Alaskan wilderness, adventures ascending Kilimanjaro and the death-defying challenges of the Annapurna Circuit trail. As his son neared his first birthday, Fischer became more determined than ever to scale Everest. Climbing down from its 29,000-foot peak in May 1996, the group he was guiding got caught in a blizzard. Everyone managed to descend to safety except Fischer, who perished from exposure. The tragedy received widespread media attention and a lasting memorial in Jon Krakauer\\'s eyewitness account, Into Thin Air (1997).\\n\\nA fitting homage to one of the great outdoor extremists.\\n(Kirkus Reviews)',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'About three months ago, after studying an excellent program by Coursera.org on modern global history, I decided to read a number of books on WWl.  I began with Tuchman\\'s \"Guns of August\"(detailing the first month of the War), then read Clark\\'s \"the Sleepwalkers\" which examined the major causes of WWl and the critical history leading up to June, 1914.  Both were excellent, 5 star efforts, well researched and well written.  I also obtained a copy of MacMillan\\'s \"Paris 1919\", which covers the Treaty formalizing the closing of the War, and I\\'ll read that in the near future.  Those of you familiar with WWl realize that the years between late  1914 and early 1918 were consumed by battles along the Western and Eastern Fronts, mostly trench warfare, with incredibly huge numbers of casualties and little advance by either side.  Significant change takes place in 1918 when Germany launches the first of a series of major attacks, followed by counter movement by the Allies, all leading to the Armistice of November 1918 and the end of the War.  There are a number of books focusing on that final year of the War and I chose to read \"With Our Backs to the Wall\" - which I now regret.\\n\\nMy major criticism of \"With Our Backs to the Wall\" is with the writing.  I found it to be incredibly dull.  There is little in the way of story-telling here, with no emotion, no sense of the commitment, suffering and loss that soldiers and those at home endured for years during the war and beyond.  Instead, the reader is bombarded with long, excessively wordy paragraphs that go on and on and on.  Battles and numbers of everything are itemized including the number of horses killed, or planes of each country at the start of a battle and the number shot down, without any sense of what a dogfight in World War One was like.  Reading this for me was reminiscent of my grade school history texts of fifty years ago, books that turned me off to history for years.  If there was a theme here, it was not at all clear to me.\\n\\nToo often, numbers in \"With Our Backs to the Wall\" were packed into the text like sardines.  The following is from page 386 in the paperbound edition, in a section dealing with The War Economies, England:  \"A generation earlier, output also slipped: from 287.4 million tons in 1913 to 265.7 million in 1914, 253.2 million in 1915, 256.4 million in 1916, 248.5 million in 1917, and 22.7 million in 1918.  In addition, the coal became \\'dirtier\\', the element of stone and shale doubling to more than 10 per cent, and productivity, as measured by tons per man per shift, dropped to 4 per cent below the 1913 level in 1917 and 6 per cent below in 1918.  Unlike munitions, steel, or the railways, the mines were dogged by labour unrest, 134 disputes between January and November 1918 involving 356,000 workers and costing 1,081,000 working days.\"\\n\\nThe above quote comprised all or parts of eleven lines from a forty-two line paragraph.  By itself, it may not appear too bad to someone reading this review.  But try imagining page after page of numbers, numbers, trees, trees - without a step back to look at the forest.  Here are a few sentences regarding a battle in the Balkans (page 145): \"As of June 1918 the Allies had 200 serviceable aircraft against 80; 2,000 large and medium-calibre guns against 1,800; and 284 infantry battalions to 254, which on paper meant 600,000 to 450,000 men, although  because of the large size of Bulgarian infantry companies the true ratio was less favorable. On the Moglena sector, however, the Franco-Serb forces achieved a 3:1 superiority of 75 battalions against 26 (36,500 infantrymen against 11,600); 580 guns against 146; 756 machine guns against 245; and 81 aircraft against 24.\"\\n\\nThe first third of the book deals with the battles of the time period (1918).  The last two thirds cover various critical topics, covering the strengths and weaknesses of the major participants, including logistics, technology, manpower, morale, subs, shipping, production, the home front.  Some interesting points were made here, particularly with the use of women in the work force.  But other items I felt should have been covered in more detail, including atrocities against civilians and the flu epidemic.  While there were stats covering the number of war dead by country scattered here and there throughout the book, I thought it would have been productive to bring that all together for the reader in a conclusion showing the contribution by country, percentage of populace etc.\\n\\nIn fairness to the author, I note that 14 of 16 Amazon reviewers scored this 4 out of 5 stars.  Incredible!  If you are seriously considering reading this book despite my comments and 1 star rating, I suggest you stop at your local bookstore, find a comfortable chair and read a dozen pages or so.  This is a 545 pager, and a huge investment of your time.  If you do road test this consider pages 245-255 on the contributions of the American Expeditionary Force.

       "  'reviewText': 'I enjoyed this book, but I can also understand why some reviewers dislike it.  I think it has to do with expectations.  This is a \"philosophy of life\" book, but if you expect it to be a sort of intellectual sparring  match between the dying Morrie and his former student Mitch, you will  likely find it \"trite.\"  No, there are no complex mental  logistics here, nor are there many references to other great philosophers  of life (although Morrie makes loose references to insights from Buddhism,  and various friends and just a few authors). The truisms are simply stated  -- understated really.  (Example:  Morrie states that one of the most  important ingredients for a successful marriage is believing in the  importance of your marriage.)  This is the type of observation that already  tells us what we know, but the truth is that most of us do need to be  *reminded* of what we know in our hearts.  That\\'s what this book does.  It  is the type of book that you read through quickly, but like to leave on an  endtable or such place so you can refer to it on occasion. It is not the  type of book that you use for a thesis comparing Morrie\\'s views to those of  Plato and others.',\n",

If you enjoy human drama on a sweeping scale, this novel has it all: action, intrigue, and passion played out among fascinating characters.  ML Malcolm brings a breathless story to life with great skill as she transports us around the world from Europe to Asia to America during the war-boom-bust-war years of 1900-1940.  I can\\'t recall ever reading a novel where such a sweeping plot was delivered with such fluidity and concision.  The pages practically turn themselves, and yet the many details of time and place that make the story live and breathe don\\'t feel lost or rushed in the process.  This is a remarkable achievement.  Oh, and did I mention that the tale itself is fantastic?\\n\\nML Malcolm has written a literate person\\'s guilty pleasure.  \"Silent Lies\" is a masterful combination of quality and fun and deserves great success.

       "  'reviewText': 'Anita Higmans newest novel, Summers List, is quite a delight to read. When Summer Snow receives the news that her beloved grandmother is dying and wishes her to complete a list of activities, she hesitantly embarks on the adventure set before her - beginning with a reunion with a long-lost friend, Martin Langtree. The adventure continues from there with plenty of friendship, family, faith and naturally, romance. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of Summers List - its an all-around cute and heartwarming read. Fans of contemporary romance should consider picking up this novel by Anita Higman when looking for a new book to read.\\n\\nThanks to LitFuse Publicity Group, I received a copy of Summers List and the opportunity to provide an honest review. I was not required to write a positive review, and all the opinions I have expressed are my own.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Donald Ray Pollock\\'s new novel The Devil All The Time is so remarkable and engrossing that I would like to share it with all of my reader friends.  However, the characters and subject matter are often so nasty, I hesitate to share this book because of what it might make them think of me.  As in, what kind of person could enjoy a book like this?  For example, this book has two different cringe-inducing preachers, one who uses various bugs (spiders and otherwise) as part of his sermonizing - eating some, getting stung by others - and the other who has a taste for pubescent girls.  But I digress.\\n\\nThe Devil All The Time is set in the years after WWII, up to the \\'60s, and features a cast of mostly rural, down on-their-luck losers and drifters.  Each of them seems doomed in one way or another, some by circumstances, others by their own nature and/or decisions.  Among the most striking characters are Carl and Sandy, a husband-wife team of serial killers.  The wife is a somewhat unwilling participant in the killings, but she is definitely complicit.  As for Carl, he is one of the more twisted killers seen in modern fiction.  The details of his methods of killing are left somewhat vague -- a rare case of author Pollock sparing us the gruesome specifics -- but what we get is unsettling enough.\\n\\nSo what makes this novel so good?  For me, it was partly that feeling of horrid fascination; you don\\'t want to look, but yet you can\\'t turn away.  The things that happen to these people are undeniably absorbing while often revolting or shocking at the same time.  Then there was Pollock\\'s gift for describing places.  With relatively spare prose, he really made some of the places he talks about seem real.  Whether it\\'s a dirty motel room or a \"prayer log\" / animal sacrifice site in the woods, I felt like I could almost see, smell and touch the places he was describing.\\n\\nIn his acknowledgements, the author thanks various organizations that have bestowed grants and awards on him.  I\\'m certain a writer of his talent will receive much more recognition in the future.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Emma Marris is a talented writer and lucid thinker who has written a brilliantly sensible book.  \"Rambunctious Garden\" is about the future of nature.  It rejects the \"wilderness cult\" and melancholic perfectionism which has dominated much of nature conservation policy in the last century.  Instead, with thorough research and documentation, Marris explains the importance of \"adaptation\" policies which accept the reality that there is no pristine nature left on this planet and that it is not possible to restore nature on Earth to its former state.\\n\\nMarris may step on some toes with her dismissal of the traditions of John Muir and Henry Thoreau whom she describes as being forerunners of a trend in conservation that, by the 1980s,  had become \"full blown misanthropy\".  One senses an impatience and near disdain in her attitude toward traditional conservation ideology and its \"Romantic, religious\" obsession with pristine nature.  She herself presents a more postmodern, realistic view of how, not simply to conserve pockets of wildernesss, but to respectfully and productively cohabit with all of nature.\\n\\nReading Marris\\'s insightful history of conservation and ecology science, I was struck by two realizations:\\nOne is how little is actually known about nature\\'s processes and how very hypothetical and untried ecological science is.\\nTwo is that adaptation models have been considered unacceptable.  Marris points out that nature is always changing and in flux--why is this news?  However, cosmologists were also reluctant to give up the \"steady-state\" model of the universe and accept it as changing, expanding; it seems the human desire to keep things as they are (or were), to want to conserve the status quo, runs deep, no matter how contraindicated by life and death.\\n\\nRegarding the many unknowns in ecological science, Marris\\'s chapter on \"rewilding\" makes evident how very difficult it is to predict what consequences ecologists\\' decisions will have on the future of nature and how even acting with the best intentions may be disastrous, although Marris is hopeful that ecological science will create balance and \"more nature\" than it will destroy.  Yet so many ecological choices and policies are based on untried hypotheses.  A plan to reintroduce large predators like lions and cheetahs to the Great Plains of the United States to bring that damaged ecosystem into balance was recently devised by a handful of men who had a meeting at Ted Turner\\'s ranch.  They suggested that \"towns and farms\" that do not want wild predators roaming their area could \"fence themselves\".  This is not all that different than current large predator policies that allow mountain lions to roam regional parks in the West, sometimes (rarely) attacking hikers or wandering into towns.  A proponent of the Great Plains idea wrote that without large wild predators \"...nature seems somehow incomplete, truncated, overly tame... Human opportunities to attain humility are reduced.\"  Personally, I prefer the John Muir style of misanthropy.\\n\\nMore disturbing, regarding the arbitrariness of hugely important ecological decisions, is the influence of commercial value.  In a chapter on \"assisted migration\"--a very new practice of repopulating species further north or further uphill to help them survive global warming--Marris indicates that a decision on what tree species to preserve on 25 million hectares of forest in British Columbia is mostly influenced by the \"surprising importance\" of just one man\\'s ideas, a British Columbia forester, for whom the commercial value of forests is primary.\\n\\nPerhaps all this arbitrariness is the underlying point of Rambunctious Garden.  Nature, Earth and its life/death cycles are in constant flux.  The only real known is that nature  will take its course.  Individual species, including humans, will have to adapt or die off.  Marris is hopeful that adaptive policies can conserve much of nature, including humanity, and she makes a powerful case for her beliefs.  Her arguments for adaptation--as opposed to only preserving hypothetical pristine baseline states for protected ecosystems--are followed by her chapters addressing responsible ecological stewardship through adaptive policies such as \"rewilding\", \"assisted migration\", \"novel ecosystems\", \"designer ecosystems\" and \"conservation everywhere\".\\n\\nMarris\\'s vision is eclectic, inclusive, pragmatic and optimistic.

They also contain a magnificent description of Sandhill cranes at a river in Nebraska which reveals her remarkable creative talent and love of nature.  Rambunctious Garden is a compelling read throughout and seems to me, a layperson non-scientist, to be a very important voice in the field of ecological science--and more, an extremely important book for absolutely everyone.',\n",

I have five children and they devour everything that I cook from this book - including my daughter that is such a picky eater I can't believe she can survive on what she eats.  I use the cookbook exactly how they say to and it works great for me.  I photocopy the shopping list, cross off what I already have, and go shopping.  I double the recipes because most of them are for 4 to 6 people and we have 7.  Then my husband and daughter can take leftovers to work and school the next day.  The recipes are very easy to prepare, the instructions easy to understand, and there are no weird ingredients.  I have already bought a copy to send to my diabetic sister and I recomend it to everyone I talk to.  Do yourself a favor and get this book!\",\n",

The Van Hooser Family is separated by the curcumstances of economic  hardship complicated by being cut off from the stability and security of place. Traveling throughout the Southern  United States, mostly by foot, the Van Hooser boys survive with a free spirited Father who conveys  an unspoken undercurrent of love and commitment to his boys. The Father is a salesman, likes his drink but  true to his profession and persistent in keeping a family together in lieu of the hardships. Despite the boys taking creek baths when hot water, soap and a tub was not available or spending days on end without supervision they adapt. They spend unstructured time  in movie houses patiently waiting for  their \"Daddy\" to returned from cold calls door to door selling picture frames. The book reveals a hidden human spirit that illustrates when love is always known to exist by youngsters a good life even in the worst of times is always near and attainable. It is a fascinating story children surviving when love coupled with education can lead to good things in spite of life\\'s many hurdles. J. W. Lee',\n",

Every empire that\\'s ever fallen has done so through overextension and through the failure to assimilate their subjugated peoples. You\\'d think that most people would have figured this out by now, and would have seen that America is blindly stumbling into these same problems. But as George Bernard Shaw stated:  \"We learn from experience that men never learn anything from experience.\"\\n\\nI find it even sadder (or funnier) that so many here apply the \\'racist\\' label upon Mr. Brimelow\\'s work. Bow down to the Altar of Diversity, or be forsaken, it seems. Those so obsessed with preaching `tolerance\\' are woefully adverse to any dissenting opinion on the subject of race. \"The races are exactly the same,\" you know. Race is just a \"social construct.\" Of course, the dramatic differences between the races have been carefully catalogued--they differ startlingly, from varying brain sizes to incompatible bone marrow--but don\\'t expect a racial nihilist to point this out to you, and don\\'t expect to read it in the Sunday paper, either. That would be `racist.\\' God forbid.\\n\\nIndeed, multiculturalism is a horribly illogical train of thought, regardless of whether or not the races are identical. It operates on the oh-so-brilliant assumption that all cultures are equally desirable. Of course, ask a multiculturalist whether he\\'d prefer immigrants that were culturally Nazi, or culturally democratic, and he\\'ll tell you democratic, nine times out of ten. So much for the `all cultures are equal\\' tripe. There are those like myself, who contend that certain cultures--oh say, the culture of Mexicans--are less desirable than others, judging from valuable little trinkets like crime statistics.

       "  'reviewText': \"It has been a year or so since I read the The Battle. A good test of its quality and value is that the complexities and color of the characters remain in memory. Well-written books have a lasting impression. This book is in that classification of memorable stories with memorable characters who jut into mind at unexpected times.  The book would stand alone as a good book to read, even if it was not part of the bigger fictional canvas of the Napoleonic Age.\\n\\nAspern-Essling was a defeat for Napoleon. The actual location is among the islands in the Danube River near to the modern center of Vienna. The battle itself is remembered for several reasons, but it is not among those celebrated by the French in the retelling of the Age of Napoleon.  After the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Napoleon started on the down-slope despite a widely celebrated comeback victory at Wagram in 1809 shortly after the crisis at Aspern-Essling.\\n\\nThis book is a clear and well tailored account of the structure of the tactical situation in the two days at Aspern-Essling. Amidst the overall structure, a certain palpable chaos reigns and the author then does a skillful job bringing out the story. Most of the notable events of the two days, such as the construction and destruction of the bridge at Lobau, are somehow packed into the story.\\n\\nWe meet a wide variety of characters in the book. My favorites include Massena, Lannes and Stendhal, the latter being the later-famous French writer, who is depicted in his role as a supply officer.  The book also develops the story of the death of Marshall Lannes (Roland of France).\\n\\nI recommend the book as a serious contribution to the Napoleonic literature. It fills a void that is left by other books. Apparently, authors tend to shy away from Napoleon's lesser defeats in favor of his greatest victories and his most tragic losses. So, if for no other reason, Rambaud is to be congratulated for his courage in taking on a more obscure scene for his excellent writing.\\n\\nRambaud is no Tolstoy or Stendhal, but he is among the better writers actively producing fiction about the Napoleonic Age. His stories are well organized and he develops excellent characters in a very economical writing style. You feel informed, aware and not rushed in his story telling. However, when you consider the length of the books and the language of the books, you fully appreciate that every detail has been organized and crafted for clarity and impact.\",\n",

With her common sense wisdom, and a detective instruction manual to guide her, Mma Ramotswe manages to find the answers her clients need, even if it's not what they want to hear.  As her fledgling business grows, she hires a sweet-tart assistant named Mma Makutsi, and she relies on her friendly mechanic, Mr. J. L. B. Matekoni, to keep her tiny white van running long past its expected lifespan.\\n\\nHave you been feeling a little blue lately?  Down in the dumps and you can't shake the funk from your brain?  These little books are the perfect antidote, because I always feel happier and at peace with myself after immersing my imagination in Precious Ramotswe's world.  Everything is painted in the vivid colors of Africa, and the slower, simpler lifestyle feels refreshing compared to our fast-paced mania of commuting, texting, twittering, and too much television.  I feel at home and connected to the people in this corner of Botswana, and it makes me hopeful that yes, we humans can share something special together when we don't let technology get in the way of meeting face-to-face.  The irony is that I'm writing this to essentially nobody, to later post on a website.  See?  We are messed up over here.  Mma Ramotswe would have sat me down with a cup of red bush tea, and let the words tumble out till the cows came home and I was feeling much better.\\n\\nThere are two utterly charming romances that play out over the course of this series, for both Mma Ramotswe and her intrepid assistant, Mma Makutsi.  Their courtships proceed with awkward, halting steps that ring true in real life, where women usually read relationships like a map, and the men are tongue-tied, wary wildebeests ready to bolt at the first sniff of commitment.  I just want to pat these guys on the head, and tell them to give it up, because the poor fools just don't stand a chance when these ladies get it in their heads that it's time for marriage.\\n\\nThe novels are fairly short, which makes each installment feel like a brief, sweet treat, and I was ready for the next one immediately, like picking a new chocolate from a box of truffles.  The touching humor, and the powerful reassurance that real human connections are what matter most in life, perk me up like a sunny day after weeks of rain.  If I could choose my relatives (and it's a pity I cannot), I would adopt Mma Ramotswe as a favorite Auntie.\\n\\nHere's a list of the book titles in this series:\\n\\nThe No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\nTears of the Giraffe\\nMorality for Beautiful Girls\\nThe Kalahari Typing School for Men\\nThe Full Cupboard of Life\\nIn the Company of Cheerful Ladies\\nBlue Shoes and Happiness\\nThe Good Husband of Zebra Drive\\nThe Miracle at Speedy Motors\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I guess love looks different from the perspective of a successful 47-year marriage -- you feel like you know a little (although not a lot) about what it is to form a relationship and to keep it growing in love. That\\'s what this book is all about, and it\\'s full of really superb advice.\\n\"If you love, you\\'re considered naive,\" Buscaglia writes. \"If happy, you\\'re considered frivolous (or, in this reviewer\\'s experience, no one believes you) and simple. If trusting, you\\'re considered a fool. If you try to be all those things, people think you\\'re a phony.\" Boy, that\\'s calling it as it is!\\nEmphasizing the importance of good communications in relationships, Buscaglia stresses the need for honesty and truth. \"Only truth,\" he writes, \" can bring us the necessary trust needed for long-lasting relationships. Only truth, painful though it may sometimes be, can create a safe environment of unity and growth.\"\\nUnderstanding the dynamics of forgiveness is crucial to those who care about lasting relationships. He discusses loving each other in joy, in intimacy and the challenge of developing trusting relationships. Friendship is an expression of deep regard for another.\\nIn a friendship, each affirms the other and reinforces his or her dignity with respect and affection. \"As the friendship becomes deeper,\" he writes, \"it becomes a sharing of vulnerabilities in a safe environment. We let each other know that our becoming is of the utmost interest and concern. We show in action that we respect and admire one another, that we enjoy the opportunity to be together and share experiences.\"\\nThere\\'s little in life that is as comfortable, rewarding and fulfilling as a long-term, totally trusting relationship based on respect and love. Following the concepts presented in this book makes developing that kind of relationship a little easier than trying to \"reinvent the wheel\" by doing it on your own.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'I stayed in therapy for 14 years.  After the initial \"help!\" I found that a good therapist will move from daily coping skills and a reconciliation of past troubles to the bigger topics of life - philosophy. I loved that!  It was like a private tutor.  After reading \"Quiet\", I immediately discovered that many years of therapy would have been cut out if I had known there was an additional, reasonable, logical explanation for how I experienced life - I am an introvert.  Introvert and extrovert are words I always thought of as \"in general\" descriptions - simply personality traits that painted a quick picture of behaviors.  To find that my high startle response, my sensitivity to commotion, my emotional response to various stimulation, has an explanation in my brain was like going from old school TV to a high-def big screen.  It changed the way I thought of my childhood, school, marriage, parenting...all for the good!\\n\\nMy grandson is 11 years old.  He is wonderfully talented in a way that inspires people to say, \"you should be in theater\".  His response, \"NO!\"  He is tapped for leadership roles in group activities.  He functions quite well - to all, he would appear to be an extrovert.  He is not.  In our \\'quiet\\' time he explains how \"uncomfortable\" this focused attention makes him.  He talks about how difficult it is to study when there is so much commotion in his class room.  \"I just wish people would just be quiet!\"  He tells his mom the reason he like being at my house is that it\\'s \"peaceful\".  So, we talk about introvert and extrovert and about the differing needs our brains require. AND that he can continue to be a happy, social, dynamic kid - it\\'s just important to deliberately tend to the quiet side of his biology.  (As you would expect of two introverts - we got out my old brain coloring book to check out our \\'parts\\' haha)  I was a lobbyist for many years, so I know I can testify before Leg. committees, meet the Governor, mingle with business and political leaders, speak at conferences.  Some of it was fun...much of it was \\'mind over matter\\' - job requirements, but definitely not pleasure.  True pleasure was in the research, analysis, and writing that came with that job - quiet, thinking, figuring out the \\'puzzles\\'.\\n\\nMy gosh, if I had known that 50 years ago, what a difference my career path would have taken.  I would have understood why a summer archaelogical dig was more attractive than hanging out at the community pool.  And I could have resisted the \"party pooper\" scold for not choosing the pool!  (I passed up the dig, sigh.)  What a difference my personal life would have taken.  I would have understood that my \"uncomfortable\" feelings were not a flaw.  I would have been given \\'permission\\' to tend to my need for quiet.\\n\\nAbout half of this book is story examples.  Maybe because I was in therapy for so long, I found them too \\'cute\\' and so I just scanned them until I got to the \\'meat\\' of the presentation.  Don\\'t be turned-off by these \\'delays\\', there is plenty in this book that I really think can be life altering.  For many of us, being \"Quiet\" is mental health.',\n",

She used to be one of my favorite authors but the turn her writing has taken is not what I enjoy reading.  I loved the stories at the beginning of the series, how the love developed between the lifemates and how the women were treated like precious gifts, even though the men were firm they were never cruel.  This book destroys that bond that you think of when you think of lifemates.  Aleksei is absolutely horrible!!  There is nothing to love or even like in him!  Boo hoo you waited over a thousand years for a lifemate, then treat her like a sub-level being or wait was it a slave!  I love strong Alpha-type men but this was sadistic, abusive garbage!  When did this great series turn into BDSM porn??  Actually, not just this series, her Leopard series has also!  I believe this started in Dark Possession and has steadily gotten worse.  My favorite book in the whole series is Dark Slayer and if anyone had the right to act like Aleksei does it was Razvan!  There was a tortured man!  There is a line between strong, protective men and abusive creeps!  Not everyone enjoys these types of stories.  Please go back to the way you used to write or you have lost another fan!',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'It is always exciting to discover a brilliant new talent. In her second thriller, The Likeness, Irish writer Tana French spins an elaborate tale that is bound to the roots of Irish history and the unique world of law enforcement as depicted by detectives Cassie Maddox, Frank Mackey and Sam O\\'Neill. Cassie and Sam are nurturing a quiet relationship that began soon after Cassie left the Murder Squad after a particularly grueling case. Now she is ensconced in Domestic Violence, certainly less dangerous than the Murder Squad or her former undercover case with Mackey. Suddenly the past collides with the present when Sam calls Cassie to come to a crime scene, the panic in his voice palpable. A body lays dead in a rural area outside Dublin in a dilapidated famine shack, a young woman who is the exact image of Detective Maddox , her doppelganger. The unpredictable Detective Mackey immediately hatches a plot with O\\'Neill\\'s reluctant approval, but the decision will be Cassie\\'s: return to Alexandra Madison\\'s life after the police announce Lexie\\'s recovery from her stab wound.\\n\\nFrench isn\\'t content with this imaginative plot, adding yet another twist to the tale: the murdered young woman has co-opted every detail of Cassie\\'s former undercover identity. Reeling from the implications of their mutual past, Cassie becomes Lexie, determined to discover the motivation for the girl\\'s secrecy and the event that has led to Lexie\\'s fatal stabbing in a remote shack. There is some indication of the many nuances at play as Mackey drills the minutiae of Lexie\\'s existence into Cassie\\'s memory. A grad student in Dublin, Lexie lives with four other grad students in a rambling estate, Whitethorn House, inherited by one of the group, Daniel March. Gradually restoring the home during quiet evenings at home, Daniel, Lexie, Justin, Rafe and Abby form a complex unit, a \"family\" that shares decisions, finances and an intense emotional bond to one another. Careful to maintain her cover, Cassie steps into the rarified world of Whitethorn House, a waiting minefield, the detective unsure how her housemates will respond.\\n\\nBlindsided by the harmonious relationships of the group, Cassie is seduced by an opportunity for closeness she has never experienced, caught between her dedication to her work and an increasing fascination with the others, the quiet, enigmatic Daniel, mercurial Rafe, insecure and troubled Justin and brilliant Abby. But for all her romantic notions of a sheltered domestic environment, real life eventually intrudes. Whether from within the house or the unfriendly village with an old grudge against the Marches, there is a murderer at large. As complex as Cassie\\'s ties to her \"new\" friends are the undercurrents of tension between O\\'Neill and Mackey, Frank a master of manipulation in pursuit of a goal. Dense and rich, French\\'s prose is evocative of time, place and history, her conflicted protagonist faced with a shattering decision, whether to embrace a new life or return to the old, a life forever changed by Lexie\\'s sad fate, \"the multiple innocences that make up guilt.\" Luan Gaines/2008.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"This book was horribly disappointing. I've read Westerfeld's other works and they aren't the best (I'll be honest, I don't get the hype) but they aren't terrible either. I'm very impartial to his writing. However, I can't deny that I hated this book! It's actually a DNF in some ways because I gave up seriously reading after 450 pages. After that, it was just some skimming and figuring out where the story was going.\\n\\nI was bored. This is my main problem. I thought this book would be an inception kind of thing where it would be very interesting. It wasn't. Half the book was about Darcy's life as an author and the other half was about Darcy's story, Afterworlds. I hated Afterworlds by Darcy Patel and was somewhat bored with Darcy's life. Darcy's life was interesting because she was on her way to becoming a debut author, but it wasn't what I signed up for. I wanted a mix of realism with supernatural. However, all I actually got was a terrible supernatural story and dry writings about Darcy's life.\\nIn addition, this book was too long. TOO LONG! I don't really need 600 pages worth of this. So much could've been cut down and that would've kept my interest for a bit longer.\\n\\nMy main problem with Lizzy's story (Afterworlds by Darcy) is how bad the pacing is. I liked how the beginning started with a bang and it totally cut to the chase. I was intrigued for a bit and then it went downhill from there. There was instalove and so much of it. They kissed at page 31. I read that and knew, I just knew it wasn't going to be good from there. And instead of building towards a climax, this book fell flat. I was so bored and nothing exciting happened. When something did happen, it was emotionless and bland because there was no rising action. It felt very erratic and honestly? Weird.\\n\\nAnd Darcy's story? It wasn't bad. It wasn't really good (not what I wanted) but it wasn't nearly as bad as Lizzie's. However, I found it so hilarious that Darcy got so much praise about how good her book was because I thought it was horrible. So I got a really good laugh out of that.\\n\\nI'm going to stop talking now because I've made my points. This book didn't agree with me at all. I was bored out of my mind and the only reason I was still reading was because I wanted it to magically get good in the end. Sadly, that didn't happen.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'Dreams of my father by Barack Obama\\n\\nThe right to vote is to be taken seriously and the election process of 2008 is and remains difficult for most of us. For me, basic questions are:\\n\\n1. What qualities do I look for in a person to lead the United States?\\n2. Where do the people running for office come from?\\n3. When did these candidates do something memorable that would inspire my vote?\\n4. Why would I vote for any of the candidates running for office?\\n5. Who are the candidates?\\n6. How do these candidates plan to lead during the next four or eight years?\\n\\nHillary Clinton is a known quantity. We have seen her in action for eight years while she was in the White House. John McCain is another person that we are familiar with, but to answer these basic questions about Barack Obama, I decided to read two of his books: \"Dreams from my father, a story of race and inheritance\" and \"The Audacity of Hope.\"\\n\\nThrough Dreams of my father we are introduced to a man raised by his mother, a white woman from Kansas who married a young African man from Kenya. The marriage takes place while they lived in Hawaii.\\n\\nBarack Obama surfaces as a person who struggles to understand the separate worlds that shaped his personality and in a search for identity he travels to Chicago and gets a job working as a community organizer. His full journey to discovery is completed when he travels to Kenya where he meets his African relatives, including his brothers and sisters, and becomes aware of the truth about his father\\'s life.\\n\\nChapter 14 was interesting because it shares the inspiration for the title of his book `The Audacity of Hope.\\' The phrase comes from a \"sermon given by Reverend Wright who read a passage from the Book of Samuel, the story of Hannah, who, barren and taunted by her rivals had wept and shaken in prayer before her God and how the story inspires a memory of a painting titled Hope, depicting a harpist who has undergone much and yet still has the desire to share notes with the one string left intact on her instrument... she dares to hope, she has the audacity to make music and praise God.\"\\n\\nDoes the book reveal qualities befitting the next leader of the USA? Has he done something memorable and worthy? Does his past provide the courage to lead those that are different and have not lived his experiences? Will Obama be able to lead our nation through these troubled times? In all fairness, read the books and make your own judgment, let\\'s hope we do what is right for our future as a democratic nation.\\n\\nThe book was rather tedious to read and frankly, you can speed read through many of the passages, but it revealed where Barack Obama comes from and how his character is shaped.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': 'It is ironic that Cliffs Notes state emphatically that they are to be used as a study guide and not as a substitute for reading the book, when summarizing the plot of Bram Stoker\\'s \"Dracula\" is what these Notes do best. The critical commentary barely analyzes the novel\\'s technique and gives no criticism of its content. It would be more useful to someone who hadn\\'t read \"Dracula\" than someone who has, but still does a disservice by not telling the reader what there is of substance in the novel or why this Victorian pot-boiler is so imitated and hotly debated more than a century after it was written.\\n\\nThe Cliffs Notes have eight sections: A short biography of author Bram Stoker, a plot summary, a list of characters, summaries and critical commentary by chapter, an essay on \"German Expressionism and the American Horror Film\", a selected filmography, a list of topics for discussion, and a bibliography. The bulk of the book are the chapter summaries, each of which is followed by commentary by Samuel Umland.\\n\\nThere are a few little errors here and there, such as the assertion in the General Plot Summary that Jonathan Harker can \"barely stave off\" the female vampires he encounters in Dracula\\'s castle. In fact, he is nearly unconscious and makes no attempt to thwart them. The summary of chapters 2-4 states that everything in Dracula\\'s castle is \"old and musty\". Old-fashioned, perhaps. But Dracula is an aristocrat, and his castle is very well-appointed. In the summary of chapters 26-27, the author claims that 6 people converge on the caravan of gypsies. Four people converge; the other two observe through field glasses from afar.\\n\\nIn the filmography, the editors have attempted to compile a list of important \"Dracula\" films that can easily be obtained by American audiences. They have omitted the Spanish version of 1931\\'s \"Dracula\", which is superior to the English version of the film. The Spanish version is available on DVD and is an essential Dracula film, so don\\'t miss it. They have rated John Badham\\'s 1979 film poorly, but it is an important adaptation of the novel nevertheless. Werner Herzog\\'s 1979 film is called \"Nosferatu\" in the filmography, which is easily confused with F.W. Murnau\\'s 1922 film. The full English name of Herzog\\'s film is \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\". Note that Francis Coppola\\'s 1992 film \"Bram Stoker\\'s Dracula\" is also a significant interpretation and essential viewing. It was made after these Cliffs Notes were compiled, so did not make the list.\\n\\nWhile these Cliffs Notes excel at providing a reminder of the major plot points, they give next to no guidance as to the many contemporary discussions of \"Dracula\". The reader is therefore unprepared to say anything of substance about the book, and, even assuming he has read the novel, will not know what aspect of it preoccupies the current academic thinking. Although \"Dracula\" has been interpreted as representing just about every doctrine imaginable, the most common discussions these days are of the novel\\'s psychosexual implications, the question of who is villain and who is victim, and the impotence vs helpfulness of science and technology in the face of ancient evils. There is also no mention of \"Dracula\"\\'s famously insufferable prose style. The novel is badly written -to the amusement of some academics and the consternation of others.',\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Dostoyevsky's magnum opus is filled with literary gold.  It abounds with deep philosophy and insightful psychology.  Really, he only seems existentialist, and spends most of the novel disproving his protagonist's motivating theory.  The philosophy is interesting, but moreso the way he refutes it.  He has a way of hitting his readers over the head with Jesus--he was devoutly religious--yet he never offends even the most questioning atheists, although the ending is a bit of a let-down.  His protagonist is a murderer, his Christ figure is a whore, and his descriptions are so vivid that one can literally smell the putrescence of St. Petersburg leaking from the pages.  Or perhaps I had an overused copy.\",\n",

       "  'reviewText': \"Thomas Harris' The Silence of the Lambs is much more than just an airport thriller.  It is a bona-fied literary achievement.  Yes it is a psychological thriller, but the novel also works on a deeper thematic level.  I could tell that there was equal thought put into the composition of both the suspenseful drama, as well as the poignant themes.  Harris is also aware of the issues that exist between men and women in today's society, and he exposes the problems that arise from these gender relationships.  Suspense is the driving force behind this book and Harris is a master at using it to consume the reader.  From the start the reader is anxiously anticipating the direction the plot will take.  Following the path of the serial killer Buffalo Bill, F.B.I. trainee Clarice Starling is thrown into a world where women are objectified and have to struggle to obtain any form of power.  She encounters opposition and encouragement from both sides of the gender line, which further fuels the conflicts at hand.  The tension constantly rises throughout the sixty-one chapters, reaching a boiling point where forces collide, causing one side to be rewarded, the other, punished.  While the suspense contributes solely to the plot, the careful use of characterization pushes the thematic level as well as the intense drama.  Harris employs a wide array of characters in his analysis of gender relations.  There's Clarice Starling, her boss Jack Crawford, the dangerously intelligent psychopath Hannibal Lector, the serial killer Buffalo Bill and the devious Frederick Chilton to name a few.  The interactions between all of these characters scrutinize the psychological implications of gender relations in America.  The fact that two of these people are extremely dangerous dramatically intensifies the conflicts within the novel.  The aspect of gender is at the heart of this book.  Every character's gender must be taken into account in order to understand their place in the world as Thomas Harris sees it.  The language Harris uses is fairly simple, but it is incredibly real.  If he were to use prose in an unconventional manner, much of the dramatic effect would be lost. Instead he presents the scenes in a very clear, yet chilling manner, enabling the reader to concentrate less on complex syntax, and more on the literal happenings of the book.  This allows for a fuller experience with the story.  From a cinematic standpoint, it is great to finally see an accurate interpretation of literature on film.  The movie accurately depicts the gender driven thematics as well as the suspense riddled plot.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to experience a great mix of dramatic and thematic devices.  Harris places equal importance on both aspects of literature, therefore creating a masterpiece for the literary community.  If you have not read The Silence of the Lambs, don't approach it as a mere psychological thriller.  Keep in mind that other levels exist, and that this book should be viewed from a literary perspective.  If you have read it before, try it out again and see what else you can find.  I bet you'll be surprised.\",\n",

While there are certain parts to this book that are tedious, and repetitive, some are simply beautiful and creative, and some are quite ridiculous.  For example, on page 173, there is a \"I know!\" word at the beginning, which reads \"the same person you are.\"  The sentence ends with, \"The same person you are\" and you see the page turned to the reader and he/she sees a quote from \"Wallace\" (which is a reference to the movie \"Wallace in the Park\"), that reads \"You know, we've spent an hour trying to figure out who we are.\"  I'm sure that this is a great book for anyone who likes a great story that gets to know them a bit, and keeps them interested in learning more about themselves.  The only real gripe is that the ending is so much longer than it needs to be, and that the author had to work so hard to get the ending to work.  He had to go and find a way to wrap it up in a way that made the book more entertaining to the point of boredom.  I don't think that I'm going\n",

Anya has no idea the identity of the object and she finds herself caught up in an alien conspiracy.

I am a clinician in a large international group of cognitive care specialists.  The information contained in the book is not only useful, but will enable a clinician, a patient and a clinician's family to develop strategies to assist them in developing a treatment plan for Alzheimer's.

The author has clearly defined a range of strategies that can be used to treat a variety of types of Alzheimer's disease.

If the author had edited this book correctly I would have liked a little more detail in how the characters evolved, but not too much.

This collection includes some really interesting poems and stories from many different times and places. I also enjoy the inclusion of some historical tidbits. This is also a collection of poetry that includes short stories from other times and places. The story of the women is well done but the poems are not. The book is very short for a typical \"light read\" and I feel that it is a bit of an exaggeration to call it \"light reading\". I recommend this book to everyone and will definitely recommend it to others.\n",

I couldn't get past the fact that the author uses the Greek word  'galek' which seems to refer to a person of particular knowledge, and the fact that this word doesn't appear in any other dictionary. I also couldn't grasp that the word Galek is the title for a fish (Greek for fish and wine). So I figured I would try and give this a try.\n",

I have read a lot and I have read almost everything by this author, so this was a bit odd. The story line is interesting, but not the most realistic one for my taste. It seemed like it could have been edited out completely to make it more believable. Some parts of the story are a bit repetitive (some are good, some are just so weird I wanted to stop reading it, but they just didn't seem to take off in any way). There was some really cute illustrations in some of the stories, but I really did not enjoy this one. It just seems that in some of the stories this is the way it is in others.\n",

I think I was thinking maybe I wouldn't like that baby when I saw the jeans because it was so big, but then I saw what I thought was going to happen when I put them down. My wife was so relieved when I saw what I was going to have to wear, and that's how it turned out for me! She got me to do the dirty laundry, clean out the room, make sure everyone got dressed, and do some cooking! Very creative and creative! It was so easy for me to just do that, even though I did get tired of the chores but the kids just loved it! My husband and I laughed so hard and talked so hard together as well!

It teaches you how you should approach your thoughts.  I have never been a Christian and I learned a lot of great things and learned how to deal with some of the most difficult times.  The book is divided into chapters for each subject so that you can understand where the ideas coming from.  Each chapter has pictures and the book shows a video of the author talking about the teachings of the Quran.

Ms. O'Connell seems to know better than to  write about any and all of these issues.  Her description of her experience, her struggles, her confusion, her refusal to trust her gut feelings are not believable,  her descriptions of the sexual abuse of her mother and sisters are simply not credible, and she does not   provide any support for her claim that the author herself was at the forefront of the problem.  The author does not even explain  how she discovered that her mother had abused her, the author does not  provide any evidence that any one was at the forefront of the problem, and the only explanation is the word  \"debate.\"  It's hard to find anything in this  book that  supports her claim that the author was at the\n",

She talks about her childhood as a child, and her family relationships.  I did like that the book was written for a woman, it was not, \"The Girl From the Trainee\" and I am glad I did.  Also, some of her quotes are from her life as a professional model and actor in New York City.  That is something that I have not seen many women do.

The book follows a story about a girl's life and her love for a man who is very attractive, and who is quite a man.  It takes place in the 1950's.  The author goes into detail about each character's experiences with the various men, and he makes the point that we have not had time to think about them and not think about who they really are, at least in this book.  This book is about a girl's life and her love for a man, and her love for a man who is very attractive and who is not quite as hot and successful as she thought.  It takes place over the course of two books.  It is told in a conversational tone and in short, to the point chapters are longer and I'm not sure it helps me at all to read this book as I do not have time to put down it.

At times I wanted to jump to the second half. She was not compelling enough for me. Her characterizations were so much more shallow than what I needed. I don't know how many of you will agree with me, but you will agree with me. It is like watching a movie where the movie character gets involved with a bad guy. It seems to have worked for her but she was too naive for a movie that was about a teenage boy. I felt like I was reading a book about an interesting character instead of a book about a character that would never get into the story. And you don't know until the movie that everything turns out very differently. I don't think it would have been a great book. I think she should have been published and her writing would've been a better option. The writing was poor and there wasn't much she could have done better. I really did want to like this book.

The plot was interesting and exciting, and while it was very original, the main characters, and even the secondary characters were well developed.

And it would be a great book to teach the \"other\" the importance of respect for one another and to be open to their own feelings as well.

Some of the more interesting passages were from her father, but Sookie, having been raised by her parents, was no longer sure what to make of that. Sookie's brother was killed in a botched robbery.

Mika was a strong character, but even she loved her sister! Livia was a talented young writer, and had the perfect sense of humor, insight and imagination to keep the mystery going. I loved reading about her life as a teacher, in a boarding school and also in the lives of two men and two women who were both very successful and very successful people. That's one of the things that makes it so enjoyable, the mystery of what happens after each person is captured and executed. That's what's important to us in this day and age when people are still trying to figure out who they really are.

In this world of serial killers, it's easy to be taken for granted, especially in a family that's a cross between gangster and serial killer.  But Alyssa is no stranger to this realm of work; she's just a regular Jane Austen junkie, and she's no stranger to the attention she gets from a serial killer.  That's not to say that Austen isn't a masterful novel writer; he's certainly a masterful storyteller.  I also really liked Alyssa's ability to weave a wonderful tapestry of emotions and ideas into an engaging, well-told tale.  I've enjoyed reading Jane Austen's stories, including one that was told from Alyssa's point of view, from the perspective of a teenager.

The story was so intriguing and full of unexpected twists, the characters had depth and their love story was believable.  I really enjoy these kind of stories.  This is an interesting idea that's easy to implement but really, it's a very unusual and unusual story for a book like this.  I was totally in love with the heroine and she was a real strong female character.  She was so beautiful, so relatable, and had an incredible sense of humor.  I really enjoyed reading this book!\n",

It seems like this is the type of book where it's all about the characters, and not the story.  I would say that for me, this book was a disappointment.\n",

I have had the pleasure of watching her recount the terrible events of the Holocaust through the eyes of the survivors.  They lived a life that did not glorify the Nazi regime and the Holocaust, but through the eyes of those who were responsible for the atrocities.  In a small part of the book, we are given the background on the events of September 11th, 2001, which has been brought to light through the author's interviews with survivors.  This book gives us a glimpse of a country that was far from perfect and was riddled with evil.  The author's personal perspective and perspective on the events in her life are extremely insightful and will make you want to live in the United States and contribute to the Holocaust.  The book takes great courage in giving the reader a good, honest look into this tragic day for humanity and its victims.\n",

You know those books where they take a child and turn it into a giant insect, then make them eat you, then make you bleed, etc.  I really like this book.

I was really excited that one of the characters was in the story, but the author has made it a bit more complicated by making the heroine a very independent person. The main problem is that he makes the heroine feel very unlikable. He made her feel pretty stupid, so much so that her friends thought she was crazy. She has to figure out who she is before she finds out who she is really and when she meets the guy who made her feel that way. The plot has all kinds of twists that make this book hard to follow. The main character was so annoying to me that it made me want to cry, but it didn't do anything to help me understand the story better.

It seems he is a victim of his father's drug abuse, and his mother's abusive behavior, but in this book he was more honest and not that forceful. That being said, I thought the story was a little different. There were a few twists that I didn't feel that there would be enough, however they do have a lot of potential. I'm not expecting much from this series, but definitely looking for a good conclusion. I know that I want to read more from this author, and I'm hoping she releases a couple of the other books in this series before the end.\n",

I find that many recipes have been around for years, and I have found numerous recipes that I have found to be extremely healthy.  I found it extremely difficult to go on shopping trips without realizing the information contained in the book is actually not only health information but healthy.  I found it impossible to find anything online that I could use in my own life.  I found it incredibly difficult to read a blog where people were sharing their experience with food.  I found it incredibly difficult to stay up all night reading the blog entries that people post on.  I feel like there was a huge mistake made in the making of this book.

Now that I've been thoroughly immersed in the mystery, there are a few things that really stood out for me.  The first thing I noticed was his vulnerability and his sense of wonder, and that's what attracted me to this book.  His character is so believable in this installment.

I've given this to three people (one dead and one alive) and have given it to four to six people (one dead and one alive) and they all have made it through much worse.

      "  Dawkins' book is a good example of what I call a \"de-jargon-storming\" of a book.  His writing is clear but he is not afraid to use it as a platform to attack specific topics and ideas.  He is willing to show the world that we have a problem and he makes it very clear.  If you are considering getting a job in a scientific field, this book may not be for you.  You may want to look elsewhere if you're looking to learn about the universe.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2:  Richard Dawkins is an excellent guy, and I loved reading his book, The God Delusion, which is a fantastic read by this author.  This book had some interesting ideas about the nature of science, and some of the ideas were good.  I enjoyed reading this book very much, and the authors writing style was very clear and direct, and not a bit preachy.  If you love science and religion, this is the book for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3:  Richard Dawkins is an exceptional writer. He's brilliant, funny, and witty. I found myself wondering at the beginning about the history of religion (since I don't know enough about it to know whether it's real or not). As I approached the end, it's interesting to note that Dawkins is far more than just a philosopher; he is a scientist and a scientist's theologian. His works are full of interesting commentary and examples.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4:  Richard Dawkins is an academic and a philosopher and philosopher of science and his books are a great deal like the first two or three of Richard Dawkins himself. This is not the book that you should read to understand his arguments\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5:  Richard Dawkins is an American who has done more than most to bring forth the most important and controversial views in the world -- that of the atheist.  In a recent book on atheism, he goes beyond the obvious points of the Christian faith and points toward a new view of religion -- that of science.  Atheism, which is not science, is science and religion is religion.  Dawkins points out that scientific explanations are flawed and that God is simply the product of people trying to see a world in terms of their own religion.  This, he says, does not mean you have to believe in a supernatural explanation -- only that you must follow one that fits your own mind and needs your support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dawkins points out the lack of scientific evidence and the scientific explanation of how things work.  He points to other religions and to atheism, which seems to be the most controversial -- that is, in many religions.  Dawkins points out that many people, even atheists, see scientific explanations of religion as somehow contradicting God -- which is not true.\n",
      "\n",
      "Richard Dawkins is a brilliant, entertaining and intelligent book whose message to a generation of young people, especially those who are religious, is simple, yet still very powerful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6:  Richard Dawkins is an awesome read and I absolutely adored his book. The whole \"God vs. Evil\" theme and what that means is fascinating and relevant in today's context of evolving religion, but at the same time I didn't think it would get any better for me with just this short review.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that the best parts of \"The Dawkins Bible\" are when he discusses various aspects of religion including the use of language, religion, morality, politics, and the scientific method. In other words, if you're a Christian you can appreciate the science of science without resorting to the same old dumb statements and logic, but in order to understand the book you have to think outside of the box.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I give him 4.5 stars because he does a great job of discussing how much science is in the creation story and how God created the world in the first place. I also like that his take on religion isn't all about the science; he makes a few points, that are interesting, but also very controversial and I didn't find his take to be particularly controversial. This is the reason I give him 4 stars because he doesn't dwell so much on religion and makes the point that the science is important\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7:  Richard Dawkins is an amazingly well-informed and well-funded religious fanatic. He is a man who has had many \"God-given\" miracles and is quite a believer. This book, however, is the worst one I have ever read on evolution. It does not really explain anything or even suggest the possibility of God's existence or God's purpose. It is very poorly written and contains many things that people do not know they are doing. It is like the textbook that says \"Science isn't based on a scientific method\". And Dawkins goes on and on about creationism, evolution, and the human body, all without really explaining how he believes anything. And as for the book's premise that there are no \"proof\" of evolution, that does not support the notion that there are. All other evidence for evolution is weak and either proves a lie or disproves the existence of a \"God\". And that does not make it any less bad. He is a great believer but he is clearly not a scientist. This book is really just a collection of quotes from other people who are totally ignorant of the science behind evolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8:  Richard Dawkins is an incredible person.  His books are always on the front page of most publications.  His arguments are always impeccable.  He shows you his real world experiences.  The best thing about his book is how many times he goes into more detail.  The \"truth\" is that he shows you not what you don't know, but how you can take it and use it.  His book is a must read for all Americans.  I think the reason why he is a favorite among intellectuals is because most Americans do not realize the truth about religion.  Religion is a hoax.  Science is a lie.  Dawkins is the proof that everything is not a hoax, but something that needs to be proven in the eyes of the American people.  If I were my father, I would know the truth about religion.  This book is not for everyone, but it will make you a lot more intelligent.\n",

It is not so hard to follow, you can read the chapters in the book before you read the book or you can follow the pages you read. It gives a good background of Dawkins' intellectual roots. He goes on to explain his ideas, his ideas are not to be taken for granted.\n",

He is also a master of his words, in which Dawkins says in The Bell Jar that \"all life on earth is an unspeakably beautiful, even beautiful, miracle.\" He is also a scientist. This is why, at his talk, he explains that we are all in the process of building a new world, which will be totally uninhabitable for us to explore until we start to make progress. We will soon make some progress.\n",

This is the second book that the Griffins haven't won since their previous book and it's not a disappointment.  We have seen the team develop and grow, but the issues remain in place.

The characters themselves were too self-centered and self-absorbed, which didn't help matters either.  The writing style was just okay.

This is a memoir about being an actress in the late '70's, working in the press, and being the youngest of the three children at home at the time.

I would recommend this book to anyone that was in a difficult time in their life, and for anyone who was struggling with what they were feeling. This book is about a mother that was forced into the Hollywood spotlight and found herself in the middle of an extremely difficult time of it all. This is a book that is highly recommended.

The character development and the way that they developed was truly amazing.  I think I had some trouble putting the book down.

What happens next is the most exciting book I have read so far in a long time. I have to say I think this author has great writing skills. I read most of the books in this series first and I really felt like I was reading through an entirely different story in this one. I'm just saying it would be good if the author had gone to a college town or town like Savannah, GA. This book is a MUST read! It would have brought tears to my eyes and made me laugh and cry!!\n",

I really liked the main character, Gabriel, who is not only very intelligent (he has a great sense of humor), but has a heart of gold as well.

It's the perfect book for an afternoon with a few friends, and I enjoyed it the most. The main character is a strong woman who is smart and strong enough to keep her job and friends at bay, and the story is good too (the main character gets more money than a normal woman, so that makes sense), and the chemistry is well done. It's like you have a romantic love interest. You really do have to give it time to get to know each other, and it's never hard to get through a book, so I recommend picking up the second book as soon as you can. I would highly recommend this book (it's good, and fun too!).\n",

But he has a past that haunts him, and it is causing him to have a difficult time in his recovery. One thing that I loved about this book was how the author developed the characters into the people she did. It was really a big change to add a lot of depth to the characters and make them more real to the world of the series.\n",

If you have, then you have to read it if you don't want to believe that the media are biased. If you haven't read The Devil Inside Me, then get The Devil Inside Me first.\n",

      "There were several things I didn't like about this book. First of all, I don't think that this is a book that should be sold as a pamphlet.

Theres a happy ending, the world's interesting and I can't wait to start reading the next installment of the series.\n",

Secondly, this book is very heavy-handed. The author doesn't even tell us where the Harry Potter books are located at all, and if they are there, they would be in the Harry Potter universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of this, the ending is basically a ripoff of Harry Potter and his adventures, which is not at all the story I was hoping to get at the beginning. It seems that there are going to be more in the series when the Harry Potter books are released, so I honestly doubt that I'll even buy the books at all. If you are hoping to get a story about Harry Potter and the wizarding world, I recommend this series as it is extremely well done and the stories are very well written, and really come across as well as well as well as you would expect from the title.\n",

It is written in a style that is not only easy to understand but very engaging. I loved the author's use of vocabulary that is very unique. The author is able to describe complex concepts very clearly and easily and this gives a good example on how words and thoughts can be used to describe many complex issues.\n",

      "8:  First of all, I like to read books from people who know them and share it.  I was surprised to read about all the books the \"New Testament\" has written, and so much more that were written by those who know the original Hebrew.  So I read this book.  It is an incredible read, even better than the original.  In fact, I felt it was right up my alley on how these amazing people were raised and how they were raised, and the life they live.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this book, one of the authors, James C. McMurtry, explains the origins of the concept of the New Testament and the way in which God has created it.  As such, it is interesting to read about the origins of all religions in the world and the influence these ideas have.  McMurtry shows how some religions, like Christianity, were created to be different, while others, like Judaism, have had to come to be viewed with suspicion because the idea of it being different was very controversial and was considered a heresy by the Jews.  He then goes on to explain how the creation of the New Testament began, what that meant, and then what has happened to each of the ancient cultures that\n",

I also loved the fact that the main character, Kaye, is a very smart person. She has a way of making people feel, and the way she is speaking of it was really interesting. The other characters are a little weird for me too. The biggest problem I have with this series is that it is kind of a one-way journey. I found myself skipping a few scenes between events in order to just keep reading to see what happens next. I just found myself skipping some more scenes in order to stay with what was going on. I still can't wait for the next book, I will definitely be adding this series to my library\n",

It was a fast paced, fun story about a teenage boy who meets his long lost mother and the repercussions of her death.  That was a little bit difficult to read but I was able to identify with her after the first few chapters.  There was a little bit of romance and the relationship between the two main characters kept me hooked from start to finish.\n",

It is hard to wait but I love how it is written.\n",

The two of them had issues in their lives, but as they got into it, they found their own way to keep it going, even going out to dinner at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was also good to learn of the true identity of the two women and the role of the mafia in their lives. The story started out just like a soap opera, but once you get going, you get sucked in.  The characters were well developed.  It kept me reading the entire book.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would highly recommend this book to any one who likes the good old detective stories.  The main characters are flawed but really are very likable.  They can seem like the perfect couple, but they are also real people and real people who make decisions based on their own experiences, not based on a series of events that make them think.  I like this book, and am going to start a movie soon, but that may not help with my enjoyment of the series.\n",

In this regard, The Human Life is a gem, because it tells the story of a woman who, through the work of a wonderful writer, had to grapple with her innermost thoughts and feelings as well as her own.  When I first read the book, I started feeling a few emotions - sadness, anger, anger.  This makes The Human Life a must read and I have already learned so much.  The story of a woman who, through the work of the greatest poet in history, had to wrestle with the questions of her own life and her own self - is one that I can relate to with ease in the book.  I have read all of the works of Louis Amatrice Dumoulin, I know more about his writings.  In The Human Life, Louis Amatrice Dumoulin spoke truth to power.\n",

I thought the author just took a bunch of things out of context and used them to create a fictional story, rather than a story that actually happened to the person who wrote the book. I didn't like the book at all. It was kind of the opposite of how I felt about the book. The only reason I did a third of the amount of reading that was done on the Amazon review page was to get to the end of the story so I could give it as much as I could before I actually finished it. I have to say it took some time to get into this book because I actually couldn't put it down.\n",

      "I felt that there were too many typos and grammatical errors. They were too many typos that could have been cleaned up (I think they should have gone in that order, but I think there were some important grammar corrections that I didn't notice) and I felt like the book was a little too descriptive. I felt like the author used a lot of slang and unnecessary phrases that didn't really work together.\n",

I had no idea that it was about the movie \"The Help\", and I was surprised to see this book on the New York Times bestseller list.  I did read \"The Help\" by David Baldacci.  He is a well-known cartoonist, and it does not disappoint.  The story follows a character who lives with three friends, and the two men are forced to live together and raise cattle.  The ranch owner, Billy Smith, is also a famous comic artist, but is a bit of a leper.  We learn much about him through the characters, and some great anecdotes about how he was raised in the ranch.  But the book is too short, and the author has a bad habit of throwing in an unnecessary chapter or two, and it is very repetitive.  I would have liked some more explanation of his methods of raising cattle, which is why I gave this rating instead.  I will keep you on the fence for another \"The Help\", but if you find it entertaining, you will definitely enjoy it.\n",

It has helped me to have an appreciation for God, to not be afraid to be thankful for Him, even when we're not thankful for Him.  I read Josh's book as a teacher and later as an adult, and I am so glad that I read his book.  Josh is an amazing speaker.  I have recommended Josh's books to many people, and I have heard from many people.  I wish Josh would publish more!  I look forward to his next book in this series.  Please write to your parents, siblings, co-workers, co-workers, children/teachers, and everyone in between, and tell your friends what they can do to get this message across.  I would recommend this book to all Christians.\n",

They have been around for centuries, but this book gives a good overview of how they actually got where they are today, with the author presenting some really interesting background information.  The author also shows how the Church grew out of this group by explaining what the Bible says about it.  It is interesting that they are not the last Christians left behind, but there were some who came and continued to teach.  This book also shows how many were executed in similar circumstances.  The author is not afraid to make a point in the book, but when you think about it, it becomes clear how many people are killed in the mass killings.  It also shows why, even during that time, the leaders of this group were not always very nice to others, but rather had great respect for them and for themselves.

I will admit I have a harder time getting into the details of the material I'm looking for, because it's not just a set of short stories.

The book begins with Paul, who speaks about his experiences in ministry, the life of Jesus, the life of the Son of God and the life of Jesus.  He then discusses Paul's many miracles in church, his many miracles during his life and his many discipleship in the church.  This is his most remarkable work yet, so it should be of great interest to those of us who have experienced the gospel.\n",

They all agree that some of the things that have occurred in this world over thousands of years make good sense.  However, they differ on what they believe Eve and Adam really needed and why.  There are many different versions of this story and some are more traditional and more biblical in nature.  This book will be of benefit to those who want to read it and others who may not.

He is well-versed in political and military aspects, and the author does a good job of bringing history to life in his stories.  There are quite a few quotes from the book, which make the book a great read, but are rather short, so the book is often shorter.

It's not so much a book of romance with lots of magic thrown in, it's a story that is about love. And in the end, love is more important than a good story, a good book is a book about love. This book takes the magic out of the book and makes it a story about love. I like that some of the \"romance\" involved was done in a more traditional way in some of the parts, like the death of the mother and the child, then the end of the story is about a woman with a child (or mother, if you prefer) to find her way, and the author also used some of her other \"romance\" in the story. The book focuses on two separate people, the main character, who love each other, and the heroine (for the most part) a little more than once or twice. The book is a little short in its length, but it makes up for it. It's a little long for a story about love that is set in a fantasy world, and\n",

Sarah's friends tell her that she is a very nice guy, and she wants to help out her business by being a model.

Her life is very interesting because we live in a time and place where the name \"Nadine\" can be used as a shorthand for the person or thing that has to be there in the world to be there. She also has the uncanny ability to take someone and throw her into a whirlwind of emotions. She has been raised in a strict Christian home and used to be totally different from what her father had taught her. I had a great time reading this story. It was the story of what happens when you are raised in the middle of a harsh climate but also the story of how Nadine became what she is today!

      "12:  This book is an insightful read, but I think the message is not new.  The author makes a few basic points but most of them are well presented.  One of the things she does well is show how the media have used their bias against the media to get their stories in print.  For example, she mentions how \"the conservative press had a very difficult time covering his criminal background\" because of the \"lack of background checks, not wanting to risk alienating the younger generation and therefore their vote.\"  When I read this book, I felt sorry for the family who felt their daughter had been left without a father.  As a Christian who has attended the same church for 30 years, and many times have seen the stories about the parents, I have to say that I don't see how this is the case.  This book addresses how the media have distorted and misrepresented the experiences of the family members they have worked so hard for.  It also shows how the family has learned from the mistakes the media made.  One thing she does well is explain what the media should have done differently when they made the wrong choice.  For example, she talks about the media ignoring the \"toxic masculinity\" that young\n",

I found myself thinking about some of the things that I would like to accomplish today in my everyday life. This book was definitely in my top 10 on that list, it makes you realize that you don't have to be a hard-working, self-centered person to be successful. I was inspired to have this book when I saw that this book was on Amazon. It is recommended to everyone, whether you are new in the world or if you have the time, it is recommended for you to read.

My two favorite parts are the quotes from the Quran and Hadith, and the insight and insights that are given in the book.  In addition, I highly recommend these two books!

It's not a guide to how to love or care for your loved ones - you need to be completely comfortable with your surroundings!\n",

      "18:  This book is an excellent introduction to the philosophy of \"The Ethics of Learning.\" It presents three main aims of the book: (1) the need to create a model to guide the development of a new philosophy of learning; (2) the need to promote the creation of an ethics of learning that takes into account the social and economic costs and benefits of learning; and (3) the need to identify and recognize the weaknesses of learning in the way that our abilities to develop and interpret learning are affected. The author gives a lot of examples, but there is really no central framework which provides clear guidance for a student's understanding of learning. The examples in this book do not cover every material facet of learning such as the use of words, how to develop the concepts in a way that the learner can easily apply and apply, how to learn the meanings of terms, how to learn how to use an analogy, how to apply a concept, etc. Rather, the author lays out a set of examples and guidelines which make the approach simple, useful and worthwhile. The book includes a glossary of terms such as \"learning norms,\" \"training models,\" \"learning styles,\" \"interpersonal learning,\" \"intellectual selection,\" \"the role of\n",

      "19:  This book is an eye opener to the history and ethics of religion.  If the reader is a Christian, this book will be a great help to understanding how our religions have evolved over time.  In fact, a study in history shows the evolution of Christianity from the earliest days in the Western world to the present day.  The author makes it clear that Christianity is not about science but about religion and that it is about human life, and that this human life is one that will determine the future of the world.  I have to admit, I had a hard time putting it down.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history of the church and religion.  If you are a Christian, and you want to know the true history of Christianity, read this book.  You will learn much about history, ethics, and how we came to be the \"good people\" we are today.\n",

It has a good plot, a great ending and really helps the reader find out who the killer is, what happened to the ones he loved and what happened to his friend.  I love how it all starts out with his friend getting involved with a girl he thought was his best friend and he wanted to be close to her, he couldn't stand the idea of her being involved.  She just said yes, he did.  And then he gets on her and they find out that he is really good at the job.  After that, the book goes on about his relationship with the girls, including her friend, being very close to him.  It doesn't take away from the story but it makes it a little more intriguing.

The story is very well written.  It moves at a good pace.  There is some mystery here.  The writing is very well done and the story flows very nicely.  It is a very enjoyable read.

I was so happy with how it ended, and how the author ended up falling for Raine, but I felt like she just couldn't get out of her head.  I was hoping that after reading this book, the author would put up with a story where the main character is so selfish that she just walks away in the story.  Why? Because it was just too much to bear.  I think it is because you don't get to see what Raine's situation is like in the end.\n",

      "\n",
      "11:  What I have to say, I'm a little confused as to what I'm getting from the author in terms of plot development and characters development. In other words, the author does not come up with an entire plot that makes sense. He doesn't use a single character to develop the story, and yet he never makes the characters more or less important to the plot. His character development doesn't begin in the first draft of the story (that's not even to mention all the \"babylonians\" thrown in here), it begins after the draft was completed.\n",

I think his first draft of this novel, \"The Fall\" by M. J.

They were both good stories that I enjoy reading and I can honestly say that I like both of them, but not so much in this case.\n",

I love that this book was written with a strong focus on the fundamentals of Java and not a focus on the language itself. Although I am not a Java programmer, I can attest to that I did not learn much about Java prior to beginning this book. Although I thought it very informative, however, its too bad that I have not heard of this book before, since its a very well organized book. It is very difficult to get a hold of an introduction to Java programming, so the book will probably not be very popular. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to Java and Java EE, and provides a number of other important tips and tricks.\n",

I think there could be a more realistic setting for the book, like a prison, like prison camps, like camp life.\n",

      "18:  What I have to say about this book is that it was my favorite book of all the series.  It has an amazing cast of characters and plot line that keeps you intrigued.  The book is about a group of vampires who are forced to battle for control of the town as they are forced to face off against a group of vampires.  In this book, all three main villains, Angel, the vampire who had been hiding in a hospital, and Klaver, the vampire who is trying to prove she can control and take care of her family.  Both villains were well-developed, and you didn't see anything new about them.  I was hooked right from the beginning and the author does a fantastic job of explaining the vampire and vampire related subtext.  In my opinion, this is one of the best series I've ever read.  I can't wait for the next book to come out.  I look forward to the movie and the book series!  Thank you Mr. Smith!\n",

I have read this book twice and never once have I felt I had any \"chaos\" and \"wetness\" in my head when I read this book. So the concept of \"chaos\" is not new to me, I have read and reread books by people who knew what they were talking about and I am not afraid to get my head around some concept.\n",

      "The message for me is this: \"Chaos can have many, many meanings. It can be a human event, a catastrophe, a tragedy.\"\n",

      "So this book helps you to understand that if there was a single event that caused the chaos and misery in your world or the world around you, you would think that it was a tragedy because you were constantly experiencing it. And if there were many, many events that caused this chaos, you would think that it was a gift because the gift was being given to you, but when you read it and look at the pictures, you realize that that the story is not just another story and that it is about who you are, but about how you are feeling.\n",

Bear in the Back picks up after the events of The Longest Journey Home.

Bear has not matured quite as fast as some of the other characters, because she doesn't really know what it is like to be human, and has lost the ability to see what is important, especially in his situation with his best friend, Grace. His lack of interest in love and trust makes him hesitant to move forward, which makes the story about Bear's growth, and Grace's relationship with him really very confusing.

It is based on a true story about a young woman, Sarah, a young woman who grew up in a very dysfunctional family that lived in poverty, and in desperate need of money. The story of her life before she was born has been told many times, and has brought many different people to this story.

When Sarah gets a call from her mother, she feels that she has a problem and needs to find a way to find some money to help herself and her family. The book is a quick read, easy to read with great pictures, great descriptions of the life of the main character, Sarah, and of how she came to be where she was in her life, and how her struggles with money and money have affected many other people.

It's where Teddy first met Bear. Lillian's husband's father, who had a crush on the beautiful little bear, was furious at Bear's conduct and took the opportunity to fire him, even though the only reason they had ever been together was to save Teddy. However, Bear had to do a lot for Bear to succeed. Bear was able to get Lillian and Teddy back together, but he couldn't get her to trust him, either, as he had no love for the man.\n",

There are some scenes I didn't get to see coming, but I love how the characters come to understand and love each other.  I don't like the idea of the main characters being able to fight and survive with a gun.  That will be a challenge for the heroine.

Billy lived a peaceful life at the town, living on the farm, where people were happy and the water was safe. Billy made his way to his home village where he lived for a couple of years before he lost his friends to cancer. While living at Billy's farm and working off the cattle, Billy noticed a young boy called Michael who was missing. Michael was a boy named James, who had a crush on Billy, but Billy didn't believe him until the very end when Michael brought him to him. Billy was upset and scared that Michael was still around when Billy had the chance to visit Michael, but Michael came back with his best friend, John, to help him out of his grief. Michael and Billy had a good time as Billy had Billy on his side. While Billy and Michael had been friends for a long time, Billy got a call from God telling him that Michael's brother, Bobby was going to die and be buried in the same area that Michael was. With Billy's help, Michael and Billy finally got to know the son that Billy had loved,\n",

It has a great deal of historical context and gives the reader a much different view of how the Civil War happened from the point of view of the author in \"the Civil War\". I like that it is easy to follow and that the author does not repeat himself, so you don't get a lot out of the book. Also, some of the recipes are a little \"funny\" for a novice cook like me, but if you know something about history and have some spare time on hand, the recipes may be a bit \"cheesy\". Also, some of the \"blessing\" recipes are pretty simple and are quick and easy to follow. I especially like the \"chocolate\" side of the recipes because I love that chocolate can be found at every table, as it is easy to enjoy and I can't wait to try more of these recipes!

She was completely unsympathetic, yet so helpful at helping others who needed her help.  As I read through it she seemed so much older than she was.  She was able to communicate with the autistic community and she was able to show me a real way of dealing with her autism without being judgemental or judgemental.  The therapy was wonderful and it gave her a lot of encouragement and she was able to do some really hard things in her life.

The plot was fast paced, which is not a bad thing.  It was a little slow moving in certain parts of the book, but still a good read.  2. I like the use of a little bit of the history of the early Christians, to make the story come alive and a little different, rather than all the time repeating history in the background.  I loved the way Christian historians had this view of the life of the early Christians, rather than just repeat the history.  Also, this book was so well written, that I just felt like I was seeing things from a different perspective: an observer of Christianity, and then I was immersed.  I'm not sure how it was possible to stay in the mindset of Christianity, but it was definitely a fun read for me!\n",

There's the usual bad guys with shady motives, bad guys who get their revenge on you just like they did with all the bad guys. I didn't like this book.

While his initial experience with violence has changed little at this point in his life, his ability to communicate with people still deeply distrustful of his authority as a police officer comes through. We also learn a glimpse of how a woman in her early fifties may have thought that her life was a good one, but that life was turned upside down by her relationship with a man who had a history of violent crimes. This book is a great one for young readers of romance, and those who enjoy a good mystery story, whether or not they have any strong feelings for lilies, or a sweet love story, this is a terrific book for young readers.

It's a beautiful story of life in the 20th century when the house was being torn down and most of us lived like cattle. There were small children, and they were little white people who loved to play outside, and it was a good family to go on holiday to. There were lots of other things happening around her house, such as a fire, a fire alarm, and even though the family was small and the fire had been put out, it was still an important time in their lives. In fact, I was so enthralled by this family that I thought I'd read a bit of history before I went to sleep; but I was pleasantly surprised at how well I connected with the characters that made up this beautiful family. I especially love this section where there's a glimpse of the lives of the young women in these tales, along with a little bit of background information about the house and family itself. There's also a fair bit of conversation that occurs in this area, so that's really good.\n",

I found that 'War with Angels' wasn't as engaging as the first two, as it doesn't really deal with battles of the Second World War (although it does try to) and there's just a very superficial mention of the 'Battle of the Bulge'.

It is like a book of short stories about the people who lived in it, and some who didn't, that they would never read or write again.  One of the stories is \"Boden\" by Charles Dickens.  It's a very interesting story and very poignant.  But it also has very few real photos of those around it.  The story itself is quite sad and sad but also very uplifting.  Some other interesting tidbits in the book are \"The Whale\" by James Thurber which tells the story of his discovery of \"The Whale's Nest\".  I'm not sure how much I like the story but I enjoyed reading it.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  I think Dickens should have been more careful in setting up the story.  His character is portrayed with depth, and it is nice to know that his main character is living his life in a way that he understands his surroundings.  This is not to say that you don't have to read some books, just don't know them.  This book could be written in any language, but I would not\n",

It's written with passion and wit, and it doesn't take away from the experience of life under the new Constitution, which has given us the tools to take our country back to the glory days of our golden age of the civil rights movement.  A great work from a man who really wants to change this country, and makes me hope that other patriots around the country get involved too.\n",

The story line is so descriptive that the reader doesn't even notice the events that took place.

There is not a lot of history in this book so it is easy for the reader to visualize the story.  The main character is a woman whose family lived in the mountains of Alaska, one of the places I was most interested in.  Her husband was a prominent scientist, who also worked with her family and was involved in much of science.  There is also an assortment of biographies and biographies that cover her entire life.  She had a wonderful childhood, was raised by her father in an environment that was very different.  She was very sheltered, but very successful in her field.  She was also very smart, and was the kind of person who thought about things carefully, without being afraid.  She could even talk to a lot of people.

Also, there is a major plot twist that I couldn't finish the book.  If I had read the book I probably would have finished it in one sitting.

I have a few of her favorites, such as \"Belly Belly\", \"I've been sleeping a lot, I'm tired,\" etc.  The author has a great way of capturing her poetry in this book.  There are two parts of this book to this book: \"My heart broke for me when I heard that this poem had been featured in this magazine.\"  I think this is the best part for me.

Then the chemistry between Daniel and Elizabeth takes off as soon as the chemistry between them is discovered.

He had a good time with her but it was more a personality clash and her actions were so immature and immature I found myself skipping straight into her story.

      "That said, the author did a good job of describing the people in his world.  It wasn't a book about what is real and what isn't so much as a detailed tour around the places, cultures, and people (as well as the people, their motivations, their behaviors, and how and why they behave).  If you're interested in understanding the culture of a place and how it relates to your own and others' lives (or, if you're more interested in the \"why\" of your behavior and/or of how to better understand that behavior), this book is probably right up your alley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it's worth buying if you're looking for an engaging, entertaining read.  The author did a good job of explaining his thoughts and feelings, and in this case, I liked the book better than the book that had a lot of pictures.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "14:  I should have paid less attention to the \"how-to\" of the book, but it was good to have.  It provides the simple and clear explanation as to why I have the problem, and why I do not.  I would recommend the book to anyone who has the same problem.  It's like trying to figure out which side of the coin to flip in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "15:  I should have paid more attention to the description of each of the chapters, because this was such a short read.  There is some interesting historical material here, but the writing is shallow and I'm a big fan of historical fiction.\n",

      "17:  I should have paid more attention to this book. I didn't enjoy reading it. The plot was weak and confusing. There were times when she was too much likeable and just not really believable. The author has a knack for making the characters seem so out of place in her plots.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18:  I should have paid more attention to the details of this book.  It has many great tips, and the best part about it is that there is no chapter that gives you any specific directions for how to use the techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the book is great, it lacks a good \"how to\" manual.  I would recommend to anybody interested in using the technique and their own imagination.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "19:  I should have paid closer attention to the writing for this review before I picked it up. It's well done, has plenty of good information, and you don't feel as if you're missing anything. You get a pretty good feel for all the characters, especially the ones you don't see everyday and who you don't like, but are also interesting and you never feel like you missed anything by the end. There is a little cliffhanger at the end, as well as a brief mention that is not included in the other reviews, but I felt it was necessary. It's a fun read. You can tell when something is going to happen, and the characters are well-developed, but the story is always good. I really enjoy it.\n",

First, awareness is only possible through self-consciousness and so one does not need the awareness of self to experience the experience.\\n\\nThis is the major problem with the \"knowledge-building\" method.  The author assumes the person already has an awareness of self, but does not present it in a way that will create awareness or allow the person to experience the experience.  In addition, the author uses the term \"awareness\" several times throughout the book, but in the end, this \"knowledge is only possible because one knows what is expected of them.\"\\n\\nMy favorite theory is that awareness arises from the individual\\'s interaction with others and does not occur at random or even during a particular moment.

After being told that she had no choice but to keep reading, she did! Livia loved her new love, Mika, and that love was strong enough that no one could stop her. Mika was a strong character, but even she loved her sister! Livia was a talented young writer, and had the perfect sense of humor, insight and imagination to keep the mystery going. I loved reading about her life as a teacher, in a boarding school and also in the lives of two men and two women who were both very successful and very successful people. That's one of the things that makes it so enjoyable, the mystery of what happens after each person is captured and executed. That's what's important to us in this day and age when people are still trying to figure out who they really are. The characters in this book are well developed, with enough depth that we feel for each other and that it becomes clear that they're not just friends. It's all about who you are, and how you handle things. And yes, it's romantic. I\",\n",

A month later, as he lay dying in the arms of his abusive ex-fianc, she takes it upon herself to find a copy in the attic and rescue him.  But her rescue comes with a whole new meaning:  The child will be returned to his loving loving, nurturing mother, who will keep him and the world safe from his abusive father.  The characters and interactions are engaging and believable.\\n\\nThe story follows the life of one of our heroine's older half-siblings, as well as the life of a young, single woman.  While these situations are typical for these two main characters, I could see how the story could be told without them being an example to readers (and the readers!) of how one person should behave in a way that would make others believe that she is not perfect and that they can be the model of how everyone should behave around them.  I highly recommend this book to parents of any age, who read it to read it aloud!\",\n",

When she makes it back to the bar the man in the mask tells her that Amelia is dead, and he is going to the police to get her. When Amelia meets someone from her family, a dead body, the man is suspicious of her.\\n\\nThis story is suspenseful, and the main characters have an interesting perspective. Although this story deals with murder, Amelia is not in a situation to be disturbed by. The main characters are believable. I was pleasantly surprised how quickly the plot came to life.\\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed this book.\",\n",

Their story begins right at the end of the book.\\n\\nThe book is a little slow to get to the \"real\" vampire story, but that\\'s because the story is not just about two vampires.

Murdering a child, she runs from it and begins a new life under her father's protection, including helping her uncle, who is also a serial killer, and a man he met at an art gallery.  In this world of serial killers, it's easy to be taken for granted, especially in a family that's a cross between gangster and serial killer.  But Alyssa is no stranger to this realm of work; she's just a regular Jane Austen junkie, and she's no stranger to the attention she gets from a serial killer.  That's not to say that Austen isn't a masterful novel writer; he's certainly a masterful storyteller.  I also really liked Alyssa's ability to weave a wonderful tapestry of emotions and ideas into an engaging, well-told tale.  I've enjoyed reading Jane Austen's stories, including one that was told from Alyssa's point of view, from the perspective of a teenager.

She has also had her own struggles with being a mother for a very long time.  A couple of her friends are also trying to help, but it's not all bad.  The other problem is that the man who she has sex with is also married to someone else.  The only way to avoid the situation is to marry another person and to be a sister to them.

She has to figure out who she is before she finds out who she is really and when she meets the guy who made her feel that way. The plot has all kinds of twists that make this book hard to follow.

The main character seemed to be \"less than\" in his \"life\" (in case you were wondering, I mean that in an un-meaning way, but I don\\'t agree with him) but I loved him more than I ever did when he was dead, and had his life saved from him.  I\\'ve given this to three people (one dead and one alive) and have given it to four to six people (one dead and one alive) and they all have made it through much worse.  So I\\'m not sure how anyone could possibly think it\\'s so good.  (The book wasn\\'t bad because it was a good read - it was just that I wasn\\'t sure I understood why he didn\\'t make it out alive - I really didn\\'t.) I\\'m not sure whether I will read this book any more.',\n",

His writing is clear but he is not afraid to use it as a platform to attack specific topics and ideas.  He is willing to show the world that we have a problem and he makes it very clear.  If you are considering getting a job in a scientific field, this book may not be for you.  You may want to look elsewhere if you\\'re looking to learn about the universe.',\n",

       " \" Richard Dawkins is an exceptional writer. He's brilliant, funny, and witty. I found myself wondering at the beginning about the history of religion (since I don't know enough about it to know whether it's real or not). As I approached the end, it's interesting to note that Dawkins is far more than just a philosopher; he is a scientist and a scientist's theologian. His works are full of interesting commentary and examples.\",\n",
       " ' Richard Dawkins is an academic and a philosopher and philosopher of science and his books are a great deal like the first two or three of Richard Dawkins himself. This is not the book that you should read to understand his arguments',\n",
       " ' Richard Dawkins is an American who has done more than most to bring forth the most important and controversial views in the world -- that of the atheist.  In a recent book on atheism, he goes beyond the obvious points of the Christian faith and points toward a new view of religion -- that of science.  Atheism, which is not science, is science and religion is religion.  Dawkins points out that scientific explanations are flawed and that God is simply the product of people trying to see a world in terms of their own religion.  This, he says, does not mean you have to believe in a supernatural explanation -- only that you must follow one that fits your own mind and needs your support.\\n\\nDawkins points out the lack of scientific evidence and the scientific explanation of how things work.  He points to other religions and to atheism, which seems to be the most controversial -- that is, in many religions.  Dawkins points out that many people, even atheists, see scientific explanations of religion as somehow contradicting God -- which is not true.\\n\\nRichard Dawkins is a brilliant, entertaining and intelligent book whose message to a generation of young people, especially those who are religious, is simple, yet still very powerful.',\n",
       " ' Richard Dawkins is an awesome read and I absolutely adored his book. The whole \"God vs. Evil\" theme and what that means is fascinating and relevant in today\\'s context of evolving religion, but at the same time I didn\\'t think it would get any better for me with just this short review.\\n\\nI think that the best parts of \"The Dawkins Bible\" are when he discusses various aspects of religion including the use of language, religion, morality, politics, and the scientific method. In other words, if you\\'re a Christian you can appreciate the science of science without resorting to the same old dumb statements and logic, but in order to understand the book you have to think outside of the box.\\n\\nSo I give him 4.5 stars because he does a great job of discussing how much science is in the creation story and how God created the world in the first place. I also like that his take on religion isn\\'t all about the science; he makes a few points, that are interesting, but also very controversial and I didn\\'t find his take to be particularly controversial. This is the reason I give him 4 stars because he doesn\\'t dwell so much on religion and makes the point that the science is important',\n",
       " ' Richard Dawkins is an amazingly well-informed and well-funded religious fanatic. He is a man who has had many \"God-given\" miracles and is quite a believer. This book, however, is the worst one I have ever read on evolution. It does not really explain anything or even suggest the possibility of God\\'s existence or God\\'s purpose. It is very poorly written and contains many things that people do not know they are doing. It is like the textbook that says \"Science isn\\'t based on a scientific method\". And Dawkins goes on and on about creationism, evolution, and the human body, all without really explaining how he believes anything. And as for the book\\'s premise that there are no \"proof\" of evolution, that does not support the notion that there are. All other evidence for evolution is weak and either proves a lie or disproves the existence of a \"God\". And that does not make it any less bad. He is a great believer but he is clearly not a scientist. This book is really just a collection of quotes from other people who are totally ignorant of the science behind evolution.',\n",

The best thing about his book is how many times he goes into more detail.  The \"truth\" is that he shows you not what you don\\'t know, but how you can take it and use it.  His book is a must read for all Americans.  I think the reason why he is a favorite among intellectuals is because most Americans do not realize the truth about religion.  Religion is a hoax.  Science is a lie.  Dawkins is the proof that everything is not a hoax, but something that needs to be proven in the eyes of the American people.  If I were my father, I would know the truth about religion.  This book is not for everyone, but it will make you a lot more intelligent.',\n",

He goes on to explain his ideas, his ideas are not to be taken for granted.\\n\\nDawkins is known to be an excellent writer. He is an expert on the topic of naturalism. He takes his ideas and uses them to explain things that many have said about religion. He also explains what scientific fact is and why they are important. Dawkins also talks about the evolution of ideas and religions in his book, \"Evolutionary Geometry\", which is worth reading if you are interested in the evolution of ideas, religion, science and the history of religion.\\n\\nIf you enjoy the history of Dawkins and his thought, this is a great book to read.',\n",

But Dawkins is not just for answers, he is also for how to answer questions.\\n\\nWhat he provides is an amazing understanding of what it is like to live on earth. The most important thing is to live on earth. That is why he teaches and educates. He is also a master of his words, in which Dawkins says in The Bell Jar that \"all life on earth is an unspeakably beautiful, even beautiful, miracle.\" He is also a scientist. This is why, at his talk, he explains that we are all in the process of building a new world, which will be totally uninhabitable for us to explore until we start to make progress.

I love that it is so easy to take time out from reading, and I have a great time talking to other people.  This book is definitely for those who love to cook and are really into learning how to cook!

While the first part of the book is very well written (it makes no pretense about the characters and is not just about the action), I found myself going into it feeling a bit lost, having not been exposed to the story for a very long time. The last thing I wanted to do was go on the search for the person I had met several years prior, and found myself skipping to the end because I had read so many reviews of this novel.\\n\\nI think the biggest criticism of this book, perhaps more than the other reviewers, is that the ending was unexpected. This isn't that the book is predictable, in fact, I believe it is the book that keeps readers guessing until the end. It is a book that has to be read, especially if you are a fan of the series.

I'm not sure if it's the same person, but it's different in several different ways.  The main character, in particular, is very introspective, but also incredibly open about things, which you get through in the first few chapters.  She's able to take on the biggest challenges of her life and really do what needs to be done to make that happen.\\n\\nWhat I really like about this book is that the whole concept of the book was actually put together through a series of short story arcs.  It was a very cool idea.  Each chapter kept me interested, though, and it really didn't hurt that I learned about the characters through the series.  Sometimes, I was surprised at what I read, but the story was interesting, and I found myself wanting to do more.\\n\\nWhile I do enjoy suspense and mysteries, I never get the same sense of urgency as a reader.  I have no idea how I could get into reading it and not get more excited about it.  This is a very well written book and I hope she\",\n",
