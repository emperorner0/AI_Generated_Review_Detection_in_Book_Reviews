While reading a couple of The Amazing World of George R.R. Martin's first novels, I wondered if I might have become fascinated by them.  They're full of such fascinating tales, richly written, with witty plots, witty characters, and interesting anecdotes.   But when I read them, I felt I'd just grown up.  A couple of years later, the story fell apart as I turned my page (on Martin's HBO series) and I suddenly realized that I'd forgotten why Martin was writing this series.  Now, it's been decades since the show ended, and I've enjoyed it more than a couple of times... A good book. But this time, I'm giving it up.  Perhaps the story will not live up to the hype the second half of its storyline had.  But despite the excitement\n"

The story is based off of a story about four brothers and the twin sisters, who all are murdered by a rival gang of robbers known only as The Black Mower Gang.  In the wake of the deaths, this family is led to an unlikely fortune that leads to a battle between two royal brothers that turns the family in two.  As the book progresses, we learn that these brothers are also, indeed, outlaws, and as a result the story is divided among them.  This, along with a series of other disturbing events that happen in the early chapters, is what makes this book so appealing.  This is a story of redemption for each of the brotherhood in this great family, the brothers who have gone against the background of their family, and is just as much a part of the story as the\n"

Some of this in a way, of course, meant that the book was written a few years ago.  However, the only reason this was so difficult to understand in English is that the grammar was too obvious.  There were passages in it that had no rhyme or reason to be rhymed, so there were very few paragraphs that could be considered in the context of a sentence.  It took me awhile to figure out what it is a sentence to do in a way that I understand in American English, and this is precisely what I did, without any help from my mother, or from my father.  Now I can't help but have the urge to repeat the story line once in one book after the first time to remind myself I understand something by the ending of a particular chapter.  This was really important to me.\n"

George RR Martin's story is one of a series of beautifully written books - the magic is as rich as ever!  Some of the characters you'd care to remember or love are here and there.  The characters you'd want to root for are so prominent.  In between these stories of family trees, there are a plethora of other things you'd want to keep in mind - the importance of a mother, father, brother, friend, lover, etc, and a mother's strength is not just there to protect her from the danger in and from itself, it's there to help her survive - and if she isn't that strong, she's not worth being around.  All of that is woven into this epic novel of great joy and sorrow.  You'd never know it at first hand.\n"

However, after being a fan of the first 3 books, I found it to be a very engaging read.  I also loved the first four books that were based on historical facts.  However, I still feel this is the most poorly written.  I also felt that this book is not realistic enough.  I find myself skipping over a lot of character's to get to the core.  I am also left wondering at the end what else they are trying to learn from the other three books.

I can certainly read the history of the various kingdoms, but without even a cursory examination, I feel like a child reading a chapter by chapter.  At times, you may have to wait for chapter after chapter until you're finished reading, or for that matter, a few chapters until you're done with what you're reading.  Characters like Daenerys and Bran the Great and the Catelyn remain an important part of the story, but, in this instance, the main characters are somewhat superfluous and do little.  I'm really not sure who the main characters in this book really are.  None of them really serve any purpose.  If you've read Martin's other work, however, it is still a good read.  The first three books of his books are filled with characters that are never introduced or who really have any bearing whatsoever in the story.  This book\n"

So much so that we spent a whole year reading them together to her.  This was great.  We read them in the evenings at work.  Her favorite book, the one I gave my 9-year-old to read in his class, was the last one we read together.  We would read each other, even though it was a very long book, because her favorite book would be \"Pumpkin and Salt\".  I couldn't get enough, just reading and thinking!  Then we started the last book together (I gave that to my 5-year-old to read to her after bed).  She had no idea what happened to the other books and decided to go for the last one.\n",

I am not sure how long it will take to finish these books to get them off the ground, but it is still an amazing read. I enjoyed how it ties together all the characters. I was actually quite disappointed with the ending of the book due to the lack of closure. I don't think that will happen because I think that it would be unnecessary to continue the storyline. But I do think that there will be some plot twists and what could make for a great book. Hopefully the book can tie up the various loose ends so we can see what happens. It was very boring for the most part.\n"

It was hard to read it in this time period - the characters aren't much like my favorite characters, but the whole family is well developed.  This book started off with the characters not having their own lives like most of the others.  The book seemed to take forever as they only got to know each other at a later time.  The only character that I really liked at all was a lowly maid.  I really wish book five would have ended where book 4 started - the way some of the new characters are brought into the story, and that's not actually how it started off.  For example, Beth was the main character that got me so excited and interested in her first book - she really started to learn about life.  I wonder how she ended up here.

      "\"Dance With Dragons\" is, to me, not too dissapointing.

Instead of taking the land as an alternate history from its origins in the past, the children of the land, along with the rest of the Narnians come to\n"

This copy does the same thing, except that there is a change to the original Wordsworth's version that makes reading this far too confusing. In order to have the proper versions available for free, an individual can request a copy of this volume as well as buying a copy for himself or his family as gifts.  I encourage anyone who likes reading an original story to check out the original Wordsworth's copy.\n"

They are told that their lives will not last forever, but only when they fight hard to become friends.  They must decide to make up their minds in a world beyond reach by traveling with other students and staying with a professor during a storm.  Soon the three young boys must turn to stone and begin to fight their way out.  A magical land filled with beasts, children, and curses.

The characters are all shallow and pointless. I don't care for the way that the story keeps going. The only characters I like are the poor guy who is thrown into a depression after his mom gets shot. I also don't care about how he survives or how long he takes to get through his treatment. The author gives a very poor summary of everything in the book.

I do think some of her character development makes her a good storyteller, and she's a bit difficult to control. I've seen a few of her appearances in the television shows and have read a couple.

      "0:  ConstitutionalGreat book. It's the type of thing that makes you want to pull up your glasses and say, \"This is what I need.\" It's also fun to read since it's written in a style I didn't know very well. It's not as dense as some of the other books I've made, but it is still a worthwhile read. The only thing I'm not sure I liked about the book is that it was pretty predictable. It's hard to picture it at all. It was also a little wordy at times. I was interested to see how things were going to play out at the time so I had a hard time reading it after being exposed to the various personalities of certain characters. Definitely worth reading if you like fiction, fantasy, mystery, whatever.\n"

At first it appeared to be a good yarn, but the writing drags on and on in too many locations.  Some chapters make you wonder what's actually happening, but the most interesting character is at the end, when all the characters are dead and not much else.  I wish George would write more of these characters and not add them up.  The reason I didn't like it so much was that it seemed like there was a lot more action to get to in these 5 books.

The characters are all so human, and are believable, that i couldn't stop reading.  I love how the author makes you care about them and how the others can and must fight for them.  My son loves reading it and can't wait for the next one.\n"

      "0: â€³My copy read \"The God of Small Things\" by Arundhati Roy, not \"Son of Adam\" by Arundhati Roy, as expected, since she is the granddaughter of a Muslim leader and the daughter of the late Nobel Prize winner Ammu Shek.  In this novel, she tells us what lives are like in a Kerala village in the 1950s with a young English professor and a gang of angry mobs.  While exploring, she meets a Chinese man, whom she has befriended, and their clash of love intensifies.  Roy is very good at creating a picture of the real-life population of a rural town, but unlike most children's novels, she has a knack for drawing the reader deeply into the story.  While all of Roy's characters are human, there are quite a few of them - Adam, an atheist with a strong religious bent, and Mama Fresia, a spinster who is a bit more intellectual than a little\n"

He keeps the tension with this novel, and keeps the reader's interest in the world through  several different plots that lead from the center stage to the end.  The book is an entertaining read, and it  brings back so many favorite characters from the past that some of them reappear  all over the place.  George R. R. Martin really brings back your favorite characters, and the world that the series has created.  He puts you right in the  mind of all the different characters that are involved in the story.  I highly recommend it.\n"

      "The first chapter of this book starts with Jon Snow being taken prisoner in King's Landing while he is being taken in.  In the next chapter, he is taken to the battlefield of the Seven Kingdoms to serve as a hostage to the Targaryen fleet.  Jon, the youngest Stark son, is given the task of serving as the head of the fleet to protect Daenerys Targaryen from an attack on the Wall, only to be rescued by Catelyn Stark.  In the end of the novel, the characters in this story are mainly Sansa Stark, Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen and Arya Stark.\n",
      "The plot of this book is pretty much the same as the first two novels but in some parts it is not nearly as interesting as the first two novels.  There is a lot of description and dialogue between the characters throughout the book but the plot does not move as much as the first two novels did.  The only character that I really liked about this book was Daenerys.  There were so many characters that it was hard to keep track of but I would recommend reading the book if you haven't read the first three novels.  Although the plot is moving at a good pace and does move at a decent pace towards the end, this book felt a bit boring at times.  Overall, I did not like it.\n",
      "Overall, if you read the last two novels that were based on this story the second half of the book did not stand up to the first two novels.  I also feel that the book is a bit too long for the plot line that was the first three novels but still leaves a great deal of cliff hangers.  In fact, I would have been better off having read the novels instead of waiting for the last few pages for the last book.\n",

Mr. Beard describes himself in a way that makes  that description even more relevant to his subject.  He also describes himself in  a way that makes it difficult for readers to understand what's actually happening, because  you are given the impression that it is the kind of story that can be told if one reads  quite clearly.\n",

      "Mr. Beard also states that he went to work in London when he was twenty-one and that his father was a doctor.  This is clearly evident in his descriptions of the  people of Scotland as they grew up and the ways in which their customs were  adopted and changed by their parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "The book is a fast-paced novel that is not predictable.  It's difficult to believe that his grandfather actually lived in Scotland, and that the author was not familiar with either.  The book is very engaging in that it was written by someone who did not live  there, and the author's ability  to relate the people's stories was extremely impressive.\n",

Both books have a brief introduction  (B) and an  introductory introduction (C), but they are so  different that they have nothing in common.  The introduction is  somewhat difficult to follow at first because of the large number of  characters, but once you start reading the introductory  introduction, you realize that you are reading this book.  It has lots of very important information.  It is an excellent source  for any preteen and adult (or any preteen and  adult reader). It's not a textbook.  There's not much  of a reason to use it.\n",
